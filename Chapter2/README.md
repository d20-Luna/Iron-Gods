## Gas Grenade

**Traits** Uncommon, Bomb, Consumable, [Grenade^](/Traits/README.md#grenade), Poison, [Technology^](/Traits/README.md#technology)

**Level** 3; **Price** 10 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L; **Craft DC** 20

A gas grenade functions like any other [Grenade^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#grenade). 

Upon detonation, the green grenade emits a 20-foot emananation of gas that persists for 5 rounds where it falls. Creatures that enter or start their turn within this area must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened 1. Creatures inside the emanation cannot reduce their sickened condition, and those that succeeded on the initial save are not immune.
