## Lashunta Heritages

### Damaya Lashunta
You’ve chosen the adaptive genetics that lead to becoming a damaya. You may be taller than other lashuntas and are likely encouraged to pursue work as a scholar or politician. You gain an attribute boost to Intelligence and an attribute flaw to Constitution, but the free ancestry boost cannot also be Intelligence. You gain the trained proficiency in Diplomacy. If you would automatically become trained in Diplomacy (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice. You gain the Additional Lore feat.

### Korasha Lashunta
You’ve chosen the adaptive genetics that lead to becoming a korasha. You may be shorter than other lashuntas and would likely excel as a warrior or explorer. You gain an attribute boost to Strength and an attribute flaw to Wisdom, but the free ancestry boost cannot also be Strength. You gain 8 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 6, and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks to Shove or Trip foes.

### Unbound Lashunta
You decided against activating your ancestry’s adaptive genetics, and you might show a combination of damaya and korasha traits; you may be tall and muscular, small and lithe, or have unusual features, such as bumps and swirls covering your entire body or long, fuzzy antennae. You gain the Unbound Mind reaction.

**Unbound Mind** [reaction] **Trigger** You attempt a saving throw against a mental effect, but you haven’t rolled yet; **Effect** You refuse to conform to the will of others, shaking off their attempts to control you with sheer determination. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws on the triggering save and other saves against mental effects until the start of your next turn.
