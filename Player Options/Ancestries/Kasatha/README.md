## Kasatha Heritages

### Historian Kasatha
You've kept up with your cultural and personal traditions. If you critically fail a check to Recall Knowledge about kasathas, kasathan society, or kasathan history, you get a failure instead.

### Reclusive Kasatha
You have no clan to speak of, surviving in the wastelands of Numeria alone. You become trained in Stealth (or another skill if you're already trained in Stealth), and you gain the Terrain Stalker skill feat.

### Shaman Kasatha
You're a natural leader and have been gifted with abilities to help aid your clan or companions. Choose one cantrip from the primal spell list. You can cast this spell as a primal innate spell at will. A cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up. You can change this cantrip to a different one from the same list once per day by meditating to your ancestors; this is a 10-minute activity that has the concentrate trait.

### Survivor Kasatha
You've been through catastrophy after catastrophy in your life, and yet endured. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8. You become trained in Survival (or another skill if you're already trained in Survival).

### Warrior Kasatha
You are a proud warrior, spending your days defending yourself or your clan against the robotic horrors of Numeria's wastelands. You become trained in Athletics (or another skill if you're already trained in Athletics), and you gain the Titan Wrestler skill feat.
