## Kasatha Heritages

### Akitonian
You (or one of your ancestors) traveled to the Pact Worlds on the Idari and settled on Akiton. Akiton’s significantly lower gravity grants you an advantage in the fun and practical art of leaping, and you likely revel in the many rituals surrounding the desert world’s popular sports. You gain the Quick Jump feat and don’t treat sand as uneven ground.

### Kasath Survivalist
You and your ancestors were among those who chose not to abandon your dying homeworld. Your people trek through wasted lands under dim skies, seeking shelter and resources even as they slowly dwindle. You may have finally decided to seek a better life, or perhaps you hope to convince others to return to Kasath with you. You can Hustle twice as long while exploring before you have to stop. If you’re in a group that is Hustling, you increase the total number of minutes the group can Hustle by 10 minutes, or by 20 minutes if you’re 13th level or higher. You gain the Feather Step feat.

### Shipborn
You were one of the kasathas born and raised on the Idari generation ship that now orbits the Pact Worlds’ sun. Your family kept hope and tradition alive while enduring the hardships of lengthy space travel. For you, the Idari is the only home you’ve ever known. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.

### Stellar Nomad
You choose to travel abroad, leaving your birthplace to embark on a journey through the wider cosmos. During your daily preparations, you can study a particular faction, philosophy, ancestry, or religion to learn one of their edicts or anathemas and gain a broader understanding of that culture’s customs and traditions. While you follow that edict or anathema, you become trained in the associated lore (such as Vesk Lore or Damoritosh Lore). This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this training is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.

### Tempering
You are undergoing your Tempering, a coming-of-age ritual in which a kasatha rejects the formal traditions of their family and experiences other customs and traditions. You may be one of the Untempered, a kasatha who chooses to continue their Tempering beyond the traditional yearlong period. You become trained in Society and gain the Streetwise feat.
