## KASATHA

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Kasatha

*Nomadic refugees of a distant world, kasathas possess four-armed torsos and sleek, muscular forms. Their noble and curious ways make them natural explorers and leaders*

No one is quite sure how kasathas first came to Golarion—even the kasathas have differing accounts. The fact that they are primarily found in the wilds and hidden places of Numeria suggests that they have some relation to the androids and other strange beings of that savage land. Whether there is any truth to this, however, may never be known, thanks to the kasathas’ secretive nature and lack of cultural memory.

The kasathas of Golarion have a cultural tradition of exploration, and when they come of age, they leave their clan, usually for 1 year, then return to their people with any riches or knowledge acquired during their journeys. This ritual “tempering” allows young adults to undergo a period of self-discovery before they assume their adult responsibilities.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Seek wisdom in history and find dignity in customs and tradition.
* Strive to maintain balance and stability in yourself and your comrades.
* Use ranged weapons when necessary but find melee weapons inherently more honorable.
* Keep your mouth hidden behind a scarf in public, carefully tucking food under it and using straws to drink.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Don’t understand your customs and mistake your veneration of the elegant past for primitiveness.
* Resent your aloofness and assume you think you’re superior to them.
* Fear you want to invade and colonize their home.
* Respect your cultural knowledge but find you stodgy and inflexible.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha’s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to humans, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.

### SOCIETY

Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one’s mouth around all but one’s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.

Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad “great families,” clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don’t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside ancestries, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.

### BELIEFS

Kasathas take great care to honor their history and follow tradition. Kasathas on Golarion interested in religion usually worship Desna or Erastil, deities that encompass exploration, family, and community. Other popular deities include Pharasma and Zyphus.

### ADVENTURERS

Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to Golarion, and to this day many kasathas are oracles, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent fighters, monks, and rangers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into magi and wizards. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent. Typical kasatha backgrounds include hermit, nomad, and scholar.

### NAMES

Kasathas go by their first names, though their full names always encompass additional names denoting parentage, clan or subclan, relation to the Great Families of Kasath, and connection to historical heroes—it’s not uncommon for a kasatha’s full name to include half a dozen such elements. For instance, a kasatha who introduces himself as Isu might properly be named “Isu Cocretia Qaru Maras of Clan Tarma, House Hadulan, soul-splinter of the line of Ru.”

## Ryphorian

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Ryphorian

*Ryphorians are trimorphic humanoids with variant physical characteristics depending on the season of their birth.*

Magic allows some ryphorians to transcend the seasonal cycle, though old stereotypes surrounding summerborn and winterborn individuals persist, as does the mystery surrounding the rare transitional ryphorians born between winter and summer. Ryphorians evolved on their home world, Triaxus, but a few have managed to make their way to Golarion via the "elf gates" of the planet Castrovel. Their Skyfire Legionnaires soars among the stars, and many ryphorians still become rangers or fighters alongside their bonded dragonkin partners.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Seek connections with your companions constantly.
* Favor weaponry that is easiest to wield while mounted.
* Modify your appearance to instil a sense of originality in yourself.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Find you a bit too clingy for their liking.
* Question you constantly about the mystical bonds your people have with dragonkin.
* Assume you have a romantic connection towards your bonded mount, be it dragon or otherwise.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Due to the generations-long seasons on Triaxus, ryphorian biology differs depending on the season in which they're born. They're separated into three categories: winterborns, summerborns, and transitionals, who often appear as a combination of the two primary forms. Ryphorians have long, pointed ears with feathered edges that give them exceptionally good hearing and particularly large canine teeth that can protrude from their mouths like fangs when they smile. In general, ryphorians have long arms and legs that struggle to retain noticeable muscle mass, though despite their lithe appearances, the harsh environment of their home planet means most have developed sturdy forms and overflowing stamina.

Winterborns have pale skin, narrow eyes to protect from snow blindness, and their skin is covered in a light fur to help protect against subzero temperatures. Winterborn ryphorians have no difficulty growing full heads of long hair even into old age, though winterborn hair color is almost always a shade of blonde, silver, or white. It's trendy for winterborns to dye their hair with bright fashion colors as a show of originality.

Summerborns have hairless bodies, dark skin tones, and wide, dark eyes to protect them from the harsh and constant rays of the sun. Many summerborns favor colorful and intricate tattoos, sometimes completely covering their skin.

Transitional ryphorians often display a combination of summerborn and winterborn traits, such as brown skin and patches of fur. Transitionals also have unusual characteristics, markings, and fur coloration; these features are a deformity to some and rare beauty to others.

### SOCIETY

With the political structure of the Allied Territories being so varied, ryphorian faiths and political views can be difficult to follow, and the societal structure can greatly differ from place to place. Nevertheless, some cultural norms exist among an overwhelming majority of ryphorian settlements.

Ryphorians tend to prefer communal living spaces. With the cultural acceptance of the ryphorian-dragonkin bond, bonded partners often live together alongside one another's domestic and romantic partners, children, and immediate family. Most housing in the Allied Territories is built to accommodate these large and complex family lives. Ryphorians who aren't bonded or lack steady romantic partners often live with several roommates, or alongside extended family, in apartments or houses with numerous bedrooms. Many ryphorians from the Allied Territories feel comfortable in groups and experience anxiety when forced to be alone for long periods of time.

Of the very few Ryphorians on Golarion, they tend to live amongst elves and gnomes, as these are the ancestries that are able to be found on the Ryphorians' home world of Triaxus.

### BELIEFS

Ryphorians tend to honor familial and friendly connections, and their faiths align with this well. Ryphorians on Golarion interested in religion usually worship Apsu, Erastil, or Shelyn, deities that encompass wyrmkin, family, and community. Other popular deities include Dahak and Gozreh.

### ADVENTURERS

Ryphorians tend to adventure with and fight best from a mounted position, and thus many adventuring ryphorians on Golarion become druids, rangers, or fighters. Those that do not find themselves with a bonded partner tap into the seasonal abilities of their heritage, becoming kineticists, oracles, or sorcerers. Others still lead by example, becoming champions or swashbucklers.

### NAMES
The Ryphorian language shares many similarities with the Draconic language, sharing phonemes, root words, and even idioms. With this influence, ryphorian names tend toward containing a lot of the same harsh sounds found in Draconic ones but with less syllables. Most ryphorian names are no more than three syllables long, making it easier to remember and distinguish many names within friend and family groups.

Ryphorian last names can be inherited from parents but are more often gifted to children by a close friend within their parents' circle. They follow the same trends as ryphorian first names and are often repurposed first names passed onto a member of the extended family. Being offered the chance to gift a last name to a friend's child is considered a high honor and proof of an extremely close friendship.
