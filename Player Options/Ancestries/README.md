## Kasatha

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Kasatha

*Nomadic refugees of a distant world, kasathas possess four-armed torsos and sleek, muscular forms. Their noble and curious ways make them natural explorers and leaders*

Kasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, kasatha leaders realized their planet was dying and made a plan to leave Kasath and settle on the distant red world in the Golarion system known as Akiton. Centuries later, they arrived in the Pact Worlds system aboard the worldship Idari, only to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay onboard the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge is a welcomed addition to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughout the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.

If you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Seek to maintain balance and harmony between yourself and others, as well as among cosmic forces.
* Find traditional weaponry to be more honorable than modern munitions.
* Keep your mouth hidden with a scarf or mask while in public.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Assume your respect for tradition gives you an inflexible view of the universe.
* Go to you for advice and expect you to provide guidance and wisdom.
* Take your prioritization of personal dignity as a sign of elitism.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Kasathas are humanoids with gray skin, four arms, and pure black eyes. They have an elongated skull that extends behind their neck, further accentuating their tall frames. After evolving to survive migrations on a  massive world, many kasathas have wiry bodies with thick musculature that makes them strong despite their lanky appearance.

Kasathas reach adulthood around the age of 25 and typically live for 100 to 140 years. Kasathas of mixed ancestry tend to come from families who left Idari during the species’ initial wave of emigration; these kasathas often use their Tempering to seek out elders who can teach them more about their traditions. Many kasathan familial communities appreciate the unique perspective these individuals can provide as kasathas learn to adapt to new homes and environments.

### SOCIETY

Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one’s mouth around all but one’s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.

Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad “great families,” clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don’t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside ancestries, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.

In the ancient past, kasathas developed a shared language that had hundreds of dialects and sublanguages derived from Kasath’s ancient nations and powerful Great Families. Dozens more dialects originated on the Idari during its long journey across the galaxy, usually derived from sectors, neighborhoods, and vocations. Thanks to their longstanding respect for tradition and reverence of history, many of these dialects live on and are still spoken in the Pact Worlds to this day.

### BELIEFS

Kasathan cultures hold custom and ancestral tradition in high regard, but each kasatha follows their own unique set of traditions, combining the rituals of their clan with those they develop through life experience. This accumulation of traditions and customs often inspires older kasathas to spend time remembering and honoring the past daily.

**Popular Edicts** maintain balance, honor your traditions, establish your own customs, cover your mouth in public

**Popular Anathema** disrespect or belittle the traditions of others, disrespect your elders

### ADVENTURERS

Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to Golarion, and to this day many kasathas are oracles, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent fighters, monks, and rangers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into magi and wizards. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent. Typical kasatha backgrounds include hermit, nomad, and scholar.

### NAMES

While most kasathas go by their first name, many have a full name consisting of up to half a dozen elements referring to one’s ancestors, clan, and connection to the Great Families of Kasath. For example, a kasatha properly named “Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan Allar and House Holdare, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts” would likely introduce themself as Barasul.

## Lashunta

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Lashunta

*Lashuntas evolved psychic abilities and a unique dimorphism that helped them survive on their homeworld of Castrovel. Lashuntas manipulate their own genetics at puberty, allowing each individual to develop into an enhanced scholar or warrior, though not every lashunta commits to these traditional choices.*

Lashuntas are natural psychics with adaptive genetics who traditionally develop into one of two heritages at puberty: damayas or korashas. They have a well-earned reputation for being ambitious, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one’s strengths, surpass one’s past successes, and strive for ever-greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training, and to embrace new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.

If you want to play a character who strives for self-perfection and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Constantly strive to improve yourself through practicing skills and honing your powers.
* Prioritize learning and diplomacy if you’re a damaya, or physique and tactical prowess if you’re a korasha— or if you’re an unbound lashunta, you don’t fit into either mold.
* Hold yourself to a much higher standard than you apply to others.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Think you’re a perfectionist and find your pursuit of self-improvement tiresome.
* Distrust your psychic abilities, fearing you’ll read their minds.
* Idealize or label you based on your chosen heritage.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

To survive on an inimical homeworld, lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow them to develop into one of two heritages: damayas or korashas. Damayas tend to be tall and graceful with delicate features and are traditionally pushed toward intellectual pursuits and political occupations. Korashas are shorter, more muscular, and gravitate toward military service, exploration, and wartime leadership. Regardless of heritage, all lashuntas have short forehead antennae that focus their telepathy, with colorful bumps and markings on their face unique to each individual. Lashuntas produce pheromones that subtly broadcast their moods in ways that other ancestries may find alluring or unnerving.

Around puberty, lashuntas traditionally choose whether to express damaya or korasha genetics—a decision that determines their physical development and influences their societal roles. Lashuntas achieve their choice through a combination of psychic ritual and gene therapy. Today, many young lashuntas have chosen to tread their own path and abstain from this choice, instead becoming “unbound.” Unbound lashuntas defy traditional roles and labels, and they may express traits and innate proclivities common to both or neither group. A growing minority of lashuntas instead pushes for further genetic diversification and aims to express unique or long-buried genetic permutations, pioneering entirely new chosen heritages. Whether such experimentation will prove fruitful is unknown.

### SOCIETY

Since time immemorial, lashuntas have dwelled in sprawling, picturesque cities along the shores and wildlands of Castrovel, a lush jungle world teeming with dangerous predators and extreme weather. These independent settlements are protected by a mighty military caste of psychic warriors, technological defenses, and magical countermeasures. The most iconic of these soldiers are the shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with (and take their name from) their saurian mounts.

Lashuntas share their homeworld of Castrovel with communities of reclusive elves and empires of fanatically orderly insectile formians. Peace between lashuntas and formians remains tentative and hard-earned after unknown ages of open warfare, which began millennia before the Gap. While lashuntas are most commonly found on Castrovel, the planet’s ancient transportation portals and the more recent advent of space travel have led many lashuntas to settle throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.

### BELIEFS

Lashunta cultures value education, self-improvement, and community defense. Religious lashuntas tend to identify with faiths that encourage balance, knowledge, meditative practice, and seeking enlightenment, such as Eloritu, Ibra, or Yaraesa. Other lashuntas shun religion entirely in favor of adopting a philosophy like the Cycle or the Green Faith, honoring a state leader, or following historic community traditions.

**Popular Edicts** never stop learning, train your mind or body daily, become the best version of yourself

**Popular Anathema** neglect your goals, wallow in failure

## Ryphorian

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Ryphorian

*Ryphorians are trimorphic humanoids with variant physical characteristics depending on the season of their birth.*

Magic allows some ryphorians to transcend the seasonal cycle, though old stereotypes surrounding summerborn and winterborn individuals persist, as does the mystery surrounding the rare transitional ryphorians born between winter and summer. Ryphorians evolved on their home world, Triaxus, but a few have managed to make their way to Golarion via the "elf gates" of the planet Castrovel. Their Skyfire Legionnaires soars among the stars, and many ryphorians still become rangers or fighters alongside their bonded dragonkin partners.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Seek connections with your companions constantly.
* Favor weaponry that is easiest to wield while mounted.
* Modify your appearance to instil a sense of originality in yourself.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Find you a bit too clingy for their liking.
* Question you constantly about the mystical bonds your people have with dragonkin.
* Assume you have a romantic connection towards your bonded mount, be it dragon or otherwise.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Due to the generations-long seasons on Triaxus, ryphorian biology differs depending on the season in which they're born. They're separated into three categories: winterborns, summerborns, and transitionals, who often appear as a combination of the two primary forms. Ryphorians have long, pointed ears with feathered edges that give them exceptionally good hearing and particularly large canine teeth that can protrude from their mouths like fangs when they smile. In general, ryphorians have long arms and legs that struggle to retain noticeable muscle mass, though despite their lithe appearances, the harsh environment of their home planet means most have developed sturdy forms and overflowing stamina.

Winterborns have pale skin, narrow eyes to protect from snow blindness, and their skin is covered in a light fur to help protect against subzero temperatures. Winterborn ryphorians have no difficulty growing full heads of long hair even into old age, though winterborn hair color is almost always a shade of blonde, silver, or white. It's trendy for winterborns to dye their hair with bright fashion colors as a show of originality.

Summerborns have hairless bodies, dark skin tones, and wide, dark eyes to protect them from the harsh and constant rays of the sun. Many summerborns favor colorful and intricate tattoos, sometimes completely covering their skin.

Transitional ryphorians often display a combination of summerborn and winterborn traits, such as brown skin and patches of fur. Transitionals also have unusual characteristics, markings, and fur coloration; these features are a deformity to some and rare beauty to others.

### SOCIETY

With the political structure of the Allied Territories being so varied, ryphorian faiths and political views can be difficult to follow, and the societal structure can greatly differ from place to place. Nevertheless, some cultural norms exist among an overwhelming majority of ryphorian settlements.

Ryphorians tend to prefer communal living spaces. With the cultural acceptance of the ryphorian-dragonkin bond, bonded partners often live together alongside one another's domestic and romantic partners, children, and immediate family. Most housing in the Allied Territories is built to accommodate these large and complex family lives. Ryphorians who aren't bonded or lack steady romantic partners often live with several roommates, or alongside extended family, in apartments or houses with numerous bedrooms. Many ryphorians from the Allied Territories feel comfortable in groups and experience anxiety when forced to be alone for long periods of time.

Of the very few Ryphorians on Golarion, they tend to live amongst elves and gnomes, as these are the ancestries that are able to be found on the Ryphorians' home world of Triaxus.

### BELIEFS

Ryphorians tend to honor familial and friendly connections, and their faiths align with this well. Ryphorians on Golarion interested in religion usually worship Apsu, Erastil, or Shelyn, deities that encompass wyrmkin, family, and community. Other popular deities include Dahak and Gozreh.

### ADVENTURERS

Ryphorians tend to adventure with and fight best from a mounted position, and thus many adventuring ryphorians on Golarion become druids, rangers, or fighters. Those that do not find themselves with a bonded partner tap into the seasonal abilities of their heritage, becoming kineticists, oracles, or sorcerers. Others still lead by example, becoming champions or swashbucklers.

### NAMES
The Ryphorian language shares many similarities with the Draconic language, sharing phonemes, root words, and even idioms. With this influence, ryphorian names tend toward containing a lot of the same harsh sounds found in Draconic ones but with less syllables. Most ryphorian names are no more than three syllables long, making it easier to remember and distinguish many names within friend and family groups.

Ryphorian last names can be inherited from parents but are more often gifted to children by a close friend within their parents' circle. They follow the same trends as ryphorian first names and are often repurposed first names passed onto a member of the extended family. Being offered the chance to gift a last name to a friend's child is considered a high honor and proof of an extremely close friendship.
