## KASATHA

**Traits** Rare, Humanoid, Kasatha

*Nomadic refugees of a distant world, kasathas possess four-armed torsos and sleek, muscular forms. Their noble and curious ways make them natural explorers and leaders*

No one is quite sure how kasathas first came to Golarion—even the kasathas have differing accounts. The fact that they are primarily found in the wilds and hidden places of Numeria suggests that they have some relation to the androids and other strange beings of that savage land. Whether there is any truth to this, however, may never be known, thanks to the kasathas’ secretive nature and lack of cultural memory.

The kasathas of Golarion have a cultural tradition of exploration, and when they come of age, they leave their clan, usually for 1 year, then return to their people with any riches or knowledge acquired during their journeys. This ritual “tempering” allows young adults to undergo a period of self-discovery before they assume their adult responsibilities.

### YOU MIGHT...

* Seek wisdom in history and find dignity in customs and tradition.
* Strive to maintain balance and stability in yourself and your comrades.
* Use ranged weapons when necessary but find melee weapons inherently more honorable.
* Keep your mouth hidden behind a scarf in public, carefully tucking food under it and using straws to drink.

### OTHERS PROBABLY...

* Don’t understand your customs and mistake your veneration of the elegant past for primitiveness.
* Resent your aloofness and assume you think you’re superior to them.
* Fear you want to invade and colonize their home.
* Respect your cultural knowledge but find you stodgy and inflexible.

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Kasathas are gray-skinned humanoids with four arms and pure black eyes. Lacking a protruding nose, a kasatha’s head is smooth and elongated, with skin stretched tight to a skull extending backward far beyond the edge of the neck. While lean compared to humans, kasathas have more advanced muscle fibers that grant them surprising strength. Physical differences between kasatha genders are slight and easily overlooked by other races.

### SOCIETY

Kasathas were technologically advanced when humanity was still huddling in caves, yet they long ago plateaued socially and technologically, learning the importance of stability and balance after a series of near-apocalyptic disasters. In kasathan culture, the answer to any question lies somewhere in the past. This leads to a culture steeped in customs that can seem bizarre to outsiders, from the common requirement to hide one’s mouth around all but one’s most intimate companions to an ironclad belief in the superior dignity of wielding melee weapons over projectile or energy weapons.

Kasathan society is generally matriarchal and nomadic, organized into myriad “great families,” clans, and subclans, with individuals and family units roaming as the whim takes them. Their conviction that most other races don’t truly understand the importance of personal dignity means kasathas rarely bother to teach their customs to outside ancestries, which leads to their reputation as being mysterious, standoffish, wise, or all three. Each kasatha follows a unique set of traditions, combining common rituals with new ones she creates. She gains more and more traditions over a lifetime, so that the oldest kasathas spend much of their time honoring the past. This accumulation of personal customs begins during the Tempering, a yearlong walkabout all kasathas undergo at the end of adolescence. During this time, young kasathas are encouraged to test their limits, learn from other cultures, and engage in normally improper behavior in hopes of coming to appreciate the value of tradition.

### BELIEFS

Kasathas take great care to honor their history and follow tradition. Kasathas on Golarion interested in religion usually worship Desna or Erastil, deities that encompass exploration, family, and community. Other popular deities include Pharasma and Zyphus.

### ADVENTURERS

Kasathas originally brought the philosophy of star cycles and cosmic balance to Golarion, and to this day many kasathas are oracles, though their physiques and love of dueling also make them excellent fighters, monks, and rangers, and the study of ancient traditions turns many into magi and wizards. Kasathas undergoing the Tempering make perfect explorers and adventurers, and in recent generations these walkabouts sometimes turn permanent. Typical kasatha backgrounds include hermit, nomad, and scholar.

### NAMES

Kasathas go by their first names, though their full names always encompass additional names denoting parentage, clan or subclan, relation to the Great Families of Kasath, and connection to historical heroes—it’s not uncommon for a kasatha’s full name to include half a dozen such elements. For instance, a kasatha who introduces himself as Isu might properly be named “Isu Cocretia Qaru Maras of Clan Tarma, House Hadulan, soul-splinter of the line of Ru.”

### DESERT STRIDE

Kasathas ignore nonmagical difficult terrain in desert and mountain environments and treat greater difficult terrain and uneven ground in these environments as difficult terrain.

### FOUR-ARMED

Characters that have more than two hands, like kasathas, can hold more items and weapons than typically expected. Performing actions with multiple pairs of arms concurrently is a challenge and can’t be done without intensive training. You must designate a pair of hands as your active hands. You can change this designation from one pair of hands to another by taking the Switch Active Hands action, which is an Interact action. You can only attack with weapons wielded in your active hands.
