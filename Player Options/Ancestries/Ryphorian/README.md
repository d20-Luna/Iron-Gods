## Ryphorian Heritages

### Summerborn Ryphorian
You were born during the centuries-long summer of your planet, or were altered to resemble such via magical means, granting you fire resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on).

### Transitional Ryphorian
You were born during the very short time of spring or autumn on your home planet, or were altered to resemble such via magical means, making you more adaptable than many others of your kind. Select a general feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites (as with your ancestry feat, you can select this general feat at any point during character creation).

### Winterborn Ryphorian
You were born during the centuries-long winter of your planet, or were altered to resemble such via magical means, granting you cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1). You treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on).
