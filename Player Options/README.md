## Ancestries

See the [Ancestries](Ancestries/README.md) page for details on the Kasatha, Lashunta, and Ryphorian.

## Backgrounds

### Against the Technic League

For whatever reason, you have a grudge against the Technic League. Perhaps you suspect the League was responsible for your parents' deaths, or you could just rankle at the League's open acceptance of slavery, their reputation for sadism and cruelty, or their penchant for hoarding and controlling technological wonders.

* You get an ability boost to any two abilities of your choice.
* You are trained in the Society skill and the Technic League Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.

### Torch Local

You have ties to a prominent local in the town of Torch - the missing wizard Khonnir Baine. If you're a wizard, alchemist or other scholarly type, he may have been your tutor or teacher. If you're of a more martial bent, Khonnir could instead have been a friend or business associate of your parents or patron. Either way your relationship has given you some insight into the residents of Torch.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Diplomacy skill and the Torch (town) Lore skill. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.

### Numerian Archaeologist

Numeria is a land ripe for archaeological exploration. You've studied the strange language associated with its eerie technological ruins, and are eager to start exploring them.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Society skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You also gain Androffan as an additional language.

### Robot Slayer

The strange automatons that plague the wilds of Numeria are a blight upon the world, and the idea that there could be countless more of these creatures lying in wait throughout the region chills your blood.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Survival skill and a Regional Lore skill. You get the Assurance skill feat with a skill of your choice that you are trained in.

### Skymetal Smith

The fires atop Torch Hill have long been a boon to smiths and metalworkers. You've always been fascinated by the fires, and this was to be your first time to use the torch for your own project. You had just begun before the violet flames went out, and you hope to find a way to rekindle the flames.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Craft skill and the Skymetal Lore skill. You gain the Specialty Crafting skill feat.

### Stargazer

The concept of life on other planets far beyond Golarion has always fascinated you, and you've long hoped to learn more about what life on those other planets may have been like. Perhaps some of these aliens can be found in Numerian dungeons.

* Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.
* You are trained in the Occultism skill and the Xenobiology Lore skill. You gain the Oddity Identification skill feat.

## Animal Companions and Familiars

Three new alien animals (Petromin, Pilo, Sorico) are introduced in Chapter 1, with a fourth introduced later (Marax). These animals may be chosen as companions with GM permission.

### Marax

Your companion is a Marax, a bipedal predator with bony growths, scythe-like claws, and a spiked tail.

* **Size** Large
* **Melee** (1 action) jaws, **Damage** 1d8 piercing
* **Melee** (1 action) tail barbs, **Damage** 1d6 piercing

* **Support Benefit** Your marax mauls your enemies with its scything claws when you create an opening. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature in the maraxâ€™s reach with a Strike, the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage from the marax. If your marax is nimble or savage, the slashing damage increases to 2d8.
* **Advanced Maneuver** Primal Pounce

**Primal Pounch** [one action] (Flourish) The marax Strides and then Strikes. If it was undetected at the start of its Primal Pounce, it remains undetected until after the attack.

### Petromin

Petromin are unfortunately too small to count as animal companions, but can be chosen as a familiar.

### Pilo

Your companion is a Pilo, a bright yellow, six-legged animal covered in sharp quills.

* **Size** Small
* **Melee** (1 action) quills, **Damage** 1d6 piercing plus pilo poison
* **Str** +3, **Dex** +2, **Con** +2, **Int** -4, **Wis** +1, **Cha** +0
* **Hit Points** 8
* **Skill** Survival
* **Senses** low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)

* **Special** The pilo's quills are coated in pilo poison, inflicting clumsy 1 to an opponent until the start of your next turn on a hit with the quill Strike.
* **Support Benefit** Your pilo embeds its quills in your foes. Until the start of your next turn, your Strikes that deal damage a creature in your pilo's reach also deal 1d4 persistent bleed damage. If your pilo is nimble or savage, the persistent bleed damage increases to 2d4.
* **Advanced Maneuver** Roll Out

**Roll Out** [two actions]; **Effect** The pilo rolls into a ball and towards the enemy. It Strides twice, then makes a quill Strike. If this movement would trigger any reactions, the pilo gains a +4 circumstance bonus to its AC against the triggered attack.

### Sorico

Your companion is a Sorico, a constantly mud-caked rodent with spade-like claws on its forelimbs.

* **Size** Small
* **Melee** (1 action) jaws, **Damage** 1d6 piercing
* **Melee** (1 action) claw (agile, finesse), **Damage** 1d4 slashing

* **Hit Points** 8
* **Skill** Stealth
* **Senses** low-light vision, scent (imprecise, 30 feet)
* **Speed** 30 feet, burrow 10 feet
* **Support Benefit** Your sorico kicks sand into your enemies' eyes. Until the start of your next turn, any creature within your sorico's reach that you damage with Strikes becomes blinded. A creature affected by this blinded condition can end it by spending an action with the manipulate trait to rub the sand out of its eyes.
* **Advanced Maneuver** Dust Cloud

**Dust Cloud** [one action]; **Frequency** once per hour; **Effect** Your sorico shakes loose a cloud of dust and sand from its coat in a 5-foot emanation. Until the beginning of your next turn, creatures within the area are concealed to other creatures, and other creatures concealed to them. Creatures within this area when your sorico uses this ability, other than your sorico or yourself, must succeed on a Fortitude save or spend its next action coughing. This uses a trained DC using the sorico's Constitution modifier or an expert DC if the sorico is specialized.

## Religion

### Casandalee

While [*Pathfinder Lost Omens: Gods and Magic*](https://paizo.com/products/btq021wf?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Gods-Magic) offer Casandalee as a potential deity choice for clerics and champions, this adventure path is set before the Iron Goddess achieved divinity. Players hoping to choose her as a deity may consider [Brigh](http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=33) or [Irori](http://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=10) as a replacement.

## Class Options

You preach messages from beyond the stars and have sway over technological creatures.

**First Doctrine (1st)** You're trained in light armor, and you have expert proficiency in Fortitude saves. Your Harm and Heal spells affect constructs as if they were living creatures, but do not affect undead.

### Nanite (Sorcerer Bloodline)

Your conception was marked by the alien influence of Numeria. Either you were born from one of the forgewombs scattered throughout the wastelands, or you were infected by nanites, which now course through your blood.

**Bloodline Skills** Arcana, Crafting

**Granted Spells** cantrip: *needle darts*, 1st: *[technomancy^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#technomancy)*, 2nd: *[vomit swarm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=726)* (takes the appearance of a swarm of nanites), 3rd: *[discharge^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#discharge)*, 4th: *[rebuke technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#rebuke-technology)*, 5th: *[mantle of the melting heart](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1373)*, 6th: *[zero gravity](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1035)*, 7th: *[regenerate](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=248)*, 8th: *[scintillating pattern](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=267)*, 9th: *[magnetic dominion](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1372)*

**Focus Rank** 1

**Traits** Concentrate, Sorcerer

**Bloodline** Nanite

**Cast** two actions

**Success** The creature takes half damage and is dazzled for 1 round.

**Failure** The creature takes full damage and is dazzled for 3 rounds.

**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage and is dazzled for 1 minute.

**Focus Rank** 3

**Traits** Concentrate, Sorcerer

**Bloodline** Nanite

**Cast** two actions

**Area** 10-foot emanation

**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

You encircle yourself with a cloak of defensive nanites. Each creature that hits you with an unarmed attack, Grapples you, or otherwise touches you takes 3 electricity damage.

### Living Swarm

**Focus Rank** 5

**Duration** 5 minutes

You discorporate into a swarm of Tiny nanites. While in swarm form, you have the swarm trait and you gain resistance 5 to slashing and piercing damage and weakness 5 to area and splash damage. You can fit into spaces only a few inches wide, moving your constituent creatures through the gap. You donâ€™t gain the swarm mind ability, so you are still affected normally by mental effects. As a swarm, you canâ€™t speak, cast spells, use manipulate actions requiring your hands, activate your magic items, or make any of your Strikes with your normal body. You can Dismiss the Spell.

While in swarm form, you gain the following damaging action:

**Nanite Overload** [one action] Each enemy in your space takes 4d8 physical damage (whichever type would affect them more; basic Reflex save vs your Class or Spell DC). Any creature that fails its saving throw takes 3d6 persistent electricity damage.

**Heightened (+2)** Increase your resistances and weaknesses each by 5, and increase the initial and persistent damage of your Nanite Overload by 2d8 and 2d6, respectively.

### Numerian Liberator (Archetype)

### Numerian Scavenger (Rogue Racket)

You live for the discovery of new technological wonders scraped from the depths of the strange ruins, metal caverns, and outlandish junkyards of Numeria. You are well-versed in all the ways that technology can be used to protect sites, as well as the ways in which it can malfunction.

If you successfully identify a Construct using Recall Knowledge, that creature is flat-footed against and takes 2 additional precision damage from your attacks until the start of your next turn; if you critically succeed, it's flat-footed against and takes 2 additional precision damage from your attacks for 1 minute.

You're trained in Crafting and Engineering Lore. You can choose Intelligence as your key ability score.

### Lucky Glitch

### Robot Slayer

**Level:** 10

**Traits:** Rogue

**Prerequisites:** Numerian Scavenger Racket

You know just where to strike robots to incapacitate and disable them. When you deal the additional damage from your sneak attack against a creature with the Robot trait, you ignore the creature's hardness (if any).

### Savage Technologist (Barbarian Instinct)

Savage technologists exhort Kellids to rise up against the depredations of the Technic League. But rather than rejecting technology, they wield the Leagueâ€™s own weapons against it.

**Anathema** Destroying technological artifacts is anathema to your instinct; defending yourself against construct creatures is not.

**Ranged Rage (Instinct Ability)** While raging, you deal additional the damage when wielding a firearm. Additionally, you do not trigger Attack of Opportunity reactions when making a ranged attack.

**Specialization Ability** Increase the additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6 if wielding a firearm. If you have greater weapon specialization, instead increase the additional damage from Rage to 12 if wielding a firearm.

**Raging Resistance** The resistance from your raging resistance class feature applies against all damage you take from creatures with the construct trait, regardless of the type of damage dealt by the creature.

### Raging Shooter

**Level:** 6

**Traits:** Barbarian

**Prerequisites:** Savage Technologist Instinct

While raging, you gain access to the critical specialization effects for ranged weapons. Additionally, while raging, your multiple attack penalty for attacks with a firearm is â€“3 (â€“2 with an agile firearm) on your second attack of the turn instead of â€“5, and â€“6 (â€“4 with an agile firearm) on your third or subsequent attack of the turn, instead of â€“10.

### Shattering Shot

**Level:** 12

**Traits:** Barbarian

**Prerequisites:** Savage Technologist Instinct

**Requirements:** You're wielding a loaded firearm and are wearing or holding an alchemical bomb or a grenade.

You fling a bomb or grenade into the air and then shoot it with your gun before it falls, raining destruction down over a wide area. If necessary, you Interact to draw the explosive and regrip your weapon. You throw your explosive to the corner of a square within your firearm's first range increment and shoot it with your firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot burst of the bomb take the bomb's normal damage with a basic Reflex save against your class DC. They don't take any splash or persistent damage the bomb would deal normally.

### Signal in the Drift (Witch Patron)

When your patron made first contact with you, it spoke in a sequence of binary code. You've since deciphered the meaning behind the numbers and connected to the metaphysical code underlying all reality, allowing you brief insights into a proto-plane known as The Drift. While this plane is centuries from being accessed by the varying species in the universe, you are able to tap into its mysteries to affect technology.

**Spell List** arcane; **Patron Skill** Arcana

### Lesson of Divine Programming

Your patron taught you that there is always a weakness in technology's defenses and how to infiltrate them. You gain the *[effortless hacking](#effortless-hacking)* hex cantrip, and your familiar learns *[technomancy^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#technomancy)*.

### Effortless Hacking

**Rank** 1

**Traits** Uncommon, Cantrip, Concentrate, Hex, Witch

**Patron** Signal in the Drift

**Actions** one action

**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature or item with the [tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech) trait

**Defense** Will; **Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

Your patron's access to the universal code manifests in spectacular glitching. The target becomes glitching 1 if it fails a Will save (or glitching 2 on a critical failure). If the target is an unattended item, it treats the result as a failure automatically. If the target is an attended item, the wielder must make the save. This condition value can't be reduced below 1 while the spell is active and you can see the target.

### Familiar of Mechanical Ascension

Your familiar is metallic in fur or feather, and its eyes seem to glow with an electrical spark. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, and your familiar is adjacent to an ally wielding or wearing an item with the [tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech) trait that is powered by [batteries^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery), it regains a number of temporary charges equal to its usage, even if the item has the [timeworn^](#Traits/README.md#timeworn) trait. Any unused temporary charges from this ability are lost at the start of your next turn.

### Technomancer (Archetype)

### Way of the Techslinger (Gunslinger Way)

Techslingers spurn unreliable gunpowder weapons in favor of high-tech armaments. They learn to master the quirks of timeworn technology and methods of keeping weapons charged in a primitive world.

**Deeds** *Initial* Reliable; *Advanced* Overcharge; *Greater* Charge Recycling

**Way Skill** Crafting

### Coveted Charge
**Slinger's Reload**

**Traits:** Gunslinger

**Requirements:** You're wielding a firearm with the Tech trait.

Your first shot with high-tech firearms preserves power. Interact to reload. Your first Strike with your high-tech firearm does not expend a charge.

### Reliable
**Initial Deed**

**Traits:** Fortune, Gunslinger

**Trigger:** A firearm you're wielding with the Timeworn trait glitches.

You have such faith in your handling of timeworn technology that you can make the best of a bad situation. When rolling your flat check for using an item with the timeworn trait, roll twice and take the higher result.

### Overcharge
**Advanced Deed**

**Traits:** Flourish, Gunslinger

**Requirements:** You're wielding a firearm with the Tech trait that has more than one charge remaining.

You have learned how to expend more power into a single shot. Make two ranged Strikes against a single creature. If both hit, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to each Strike normally.

### Charge Recycling
**Greater Deed**

**Traits:** Gunslinger

**Requirements:** You're wielding a firearm with the Tech trait that has 0 charges remaining.

**Frequency:** Once per round.

You draw from whatever residual energy may be remaining in your high-tech firearm, even if it cannot be recharged. Your high-tech firearm gains a single charge, which must be used within the next hour.

### Technic Training

**Level:** 6

**Traits:** Gunslinger

**Prerequisites:** Way of the Techslinger

You've studied the high-tech firearms of Numeria and have a definitive favorite. Choose one specific firearm with the Tech trait (such as an arc pistol or a laser rifle) that you're trained with. You deal an additional 2 points of damage with the chosen firearm. This additional damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.

### True Techslinger
**Level:** 14

**Traits:** Gunslinger

**Prerequisite:** Technic Training

You're so confident in your favored firearm that it rarely malfunctions for you. When wielding your favored firearm with the Timeworn trait, you treat the firearm as if it does not have the timeworn trait, allowing you to ignore the Glitching condition and reload or recharge the firearm.
