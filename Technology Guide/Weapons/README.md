# Weapon Descriptions

## Simple Melee Weapons

**Inferno Knife:** This military-grade blade has a line of material running through the center of the blade that can be briefly ignited.

**Laser Torch:** This handheld tool looks like a blunt-tipped laser pistol. It is intended to cut through objects with great speed. When used against unattended objects or structures, the laser torch is able to ignore 10 points of Hardness unless the target is particularly fire-resistant.

**Lumenstaff:** This staff has a hollowed-out tip that contains a biolumenescent algae. On a successful Strike, the algae within the lumenstaff illuminates, releasing light as a torch for 1 round. Additionally, Strikes made with a lumenstaff do not take a penalty when made underwater.

**Spined Blade:** These hardened bone blades are the favored weapons of those who call the alien planet Kasath their home. When poison is applied to a spined blade, the DC of the poison is increased by 2.

## Martial Melee Weapons

**Monk's Spade:** 

## Simple Ranged Weapons

**Dart Gun:** Dart guns fire condensed needles of nanites at ranged targets. Dart guns possess small resevoirs above their handles into which a single dose of a pharmaceutical, drug, poison, or even a potion can be poured as an Interact action. The next dart fired from the dart gun delivers that liquid into the target immediately upon a hit.

**EMP Pistol:** EMP pistols contain a number of electromagnetically-charged spikes protruding from their barrels. An EMP pistol emits a beam of electromagnetic energy that only deals full damage to creatures with the tech trait. An EMP pistol can harm androids, automatons, and creatures with cybernetic implants, but they take half damage from a hit.

**EMP Rifle:** EMP rifles contain a series of electromagnetically-charges spikes within their barrels. An EMP rifle emits a beam of electromagnetic energy that only deals full damage to creatures with the tech trait, and half damage to androids, automatons, and creatures with cybernetic implants.

**Gravity Pistol:** Gravity pistols use forked prongs protruding from their barrels to fire specialized beams of gravitons to batter and reposition foes.

**Gravity Rifle:** Gravity rifles use multiple forked prongs protruding from their barrels to fire powerful, specialized beams of gravitons to batter and reposition foes.

**Id Rifle:** This sleek, low-caliber rifle is made of a burnished skymetal. An id rifle fires tiny barbs of nanites that target the nervous system and possesses a microphone in its stock. A creature damaged by an id rifle must make a Will save against your Class DC. On a failure, the target is stupefied 1. On a critical failure, the target is stupefied 3. If the target is already stupefied, their stupefied value increases by the same amount. Additionally, as a command action that has a usage of 1, you can attempt to affect all creatures within 50 feet that have been damaged by your id rifle within the past 24 hours with a non-magical *suggestion* effect, using your Class DC.

**Inferno Pistol:** An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistol, which generates a blob of molten nanites to burn its targets.

**Mindburner:** Mindburners have dishlike devices at the end of their barrels, where a small wisp of smoke pools before releasing a beam of white light. On a successful hit, the target must make a Will save against your Class DC. On a failure, the target is stupefied 1 for 1 round. On a critical failure, the target is stupefied 2 for 1 round, and stupefied 1 for 1 minute.

**Mindrender:** Mindrenders emit a carrier waves of light which transmit masses of nanites into the body of their targets. On a successful Strike, the target must make a Fortitude save against your Class DC as its mind and body are wracked by the nanites. On a critical hit, the target takes a -2 penalty on its save against the nanites. On a critical success, the target is unaffected by the nanites and is immune to the mindrender for 1 hour. On a success, the target takes half damage and is sickened 1 and is immune to the mindrender for 1 hour. On a failure, the target takes full damage and is stunned 1 and sickened 2. On a critical failure, the target takes double damage and is stunned 2, slowed 1, and sickened 3.

# Special Technological Weaponry

The following technological weapons do not function as standard weapons, or are magically crafted pieces of weaponry that transcend the standard rules for technological items.

## Atom Gun

**Level** 18; **Price** 25,000 gp; **Bulk** 2; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Poison](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [Radiation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=421), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)
 
An atom gun is a cruel weapon that harnesses the devastating energies of a miniaturized nuclear reactor to create a focused cone of radiation that blasts and sickens those caught in the beam. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

An atom gun has a miniaturized nuclear reactor inside powering it, and therefore does not require recharging from batteries like most high-tech items, but if the atom gun becomes broken, its power supply grows unreliable. In such a case, each time the atom gun is activated, the user must also succeed at a DC 5 flat check. Failure indicates that the gun's power supply fails and causes the gun to explode. This destroys the gun and subjects the wielder to high technological radiation. Additionally, if the gun is destroyed through other means, the gun's current wielder must make a successful DC 11 flat check to avoid having the gun explode in the same way. A destroyed atom gun becomes a constant source of radiation poisoning, affecting all creatures touching it with high technological radiation, creatures within 10 feet of it with medium technological radiation, and creatures within 30 feet of it with low technological radiation.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact (radiation); **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You fire the atom gun in a 40-foot cone. Creatures in the cone are affected by medium technological radiation. After the wielder resolves this activation, they take 1d6 points of fire damage from the atom gun heating up and beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.
 
## Death Ray

**Level** 18; **Price** 30,000 gp; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 1

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Death](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=40) , [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

A death ray is a handheld, wand-like device that fires a harmless carrier beam of energy at a target. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A death ray's power is provided by a [nanite canister^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#nanite-canister). A full nanite canister has 10 charges. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Effect** You turn the dial on the death ray, selecting the number of charges you wish to use when activating its secondary activation.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Frequency** once per turn; **Charges** 1+; **Effect** You fire the death ray at a creature within 200 feet, projecting a stream of specialized nanites through the beam into the body of the target. Make a ranged Strike, treating the death ray as an Advanced Firearm. On a success, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected by a 9th-rank *disintegrate* effect. You can expend additional charges, up to a maximum of 10. For each additional charge spent beyond the first, the Fortitude save increases by 2, to a maximum of a DC of 38. A death ray does not affect non-living creatures (such as constructs or undead), nor can it penetrate a force field.

## Flare Gun

**Level** 0+

**Traits** Consumable, Tech

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

**Activate** [one-action] Area Fire

A flare gun looks like a wide-barreled pistol, and although it can be used in combat, the item’s primary use is to send signals. A flare gun and its ammunition (a small, rocket-propelled magnesium charge) are completely self-contained and disposable—once fired, a flare gun is useless. Treat the flare gun as a Simple Firearm that deals fire damage, is in the [Flame] Weapon Group, with a range of 120 feet, and the [Area] (burst), [Analog], and [Tech] traits. The flare detonates once it hits a target or reaches its maximum range of 600 feet, bursting into a sphere of fire that illuminates a 120-foot-radius area for 1 minute as it drifts slowly back to the ground. Any creatures within 20 feet of the flare must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against your Class DC each round or be dazzled by the intense light for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

**Type** commercial; **Level** 0; **Price** 10 credits

The radius is 5 feet and deals 1d6 fire damage.

**Type** tactical; **Level** 2; **Price** 80 credits

The radius is 10 feet, deals 1d6 fire damage, and has the [Tracking] +1 trait.

**Type** elite; **Level** 12; **Price** 3000 credits

The radius is 15 feet, deals 3d6 fire damage, and has the [Tracking] +2 trait.

**Type** ultimate; **Level** 16; **Price** 13000 credits

The radius is 20 feet, deals 3d6 fire damage, and has the [Tracking] +3 trait.

**Type** paragon; **Level** 19; **Price** 50000 credits

The radius is 20 feet, deals 4d6 fire damage, and has the [Tracking] +3 trait.
 
## Monowhip

**Level** 15; **Price** 6,500 gp; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 1

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

This short, metal baton when activated reveals a monofilament length. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A monowhip's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

When not activated, a monowhip can be wielded as a [club](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=2). You can't etch property runes into a monowhip.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The monowhip extends its monofilament length, gaining the effects of a *[+2](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=281) [adamantine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=374) [greater striking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [grievous](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=298) [scorpion whip](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=114)*. It uses an additional charge at the start of each of the user's turns while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.
 
## Nuclear Resonator

**Level** 16; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Bulk** 2; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Incapacitation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Sonic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=147), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

This bulky handheld cannon produces a droning shriek when fired. The item constantly buzzes, whirs, and flashes when not activated, imparting a -4 item penalty to the wielder's Stealth. It can be completely powered off with an Interact action to negate this penalty, but must be powered back on with another Interact action before it can be activated. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A nuclear resonator's power is provided by [batteries^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges, while a nuclear resonator can hold two batteries. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Frequency** once per round; **Charges** 5; **Effect** The nuclear resonator releases a highly focused beam of sound that swiftly modulates to resonate at the atomic frequency of the first target it strikes. Make a ranged Strike, treating the resonator as an Advanced Firearm, and compare the result to all creatures in an 80 foot line. The nuclear resonator deals 6d12 sonic damage to the first creature in the line whose AC is equal to or less than the result. Other targets with the same creature type trait in the line take 4d12 sonic damage, while other creatures take 2d12 sonic damage. If the Strike is a critical hit due to a natural 20, choose one creature in the line to be critically hit, the rest are treated as a standard success. A creature critically hit by the resonator must make a DC 35 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d6 rounds and stunned 3. Creatures reduced to dying by a nuclear resonator are disintegrated as per the spell.
 
## Null Blade

**Level** 14; **Price** 6,000 gp; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Magical](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Base Weapon** [Bastard Sword](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)

A potent fusion of magic, advanced science, and masterful weaponsmithing, this weapon incorporates an adamantine-noqual alloy in its blade. It is treated as both an [adamantine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=374) weapon and a [noqual](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1422) weapon.

A null blade's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges, while a null blade can hold two batteries. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

When not activated, a null blade gains the effects of a *[+1](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=281) [adamantine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=374)-[noqual](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1422) [construct-bane](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1041) [striking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [bastard sword](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)*. You can't etch property runes into a null blade.

**Activate** [free action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** A shimmering field of green energy envelops the null blade, disrupting magic and technology alike. While activated, it gains the effects of a *[+2](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=281) [adamantine](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=374)-[noqual](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1422) [construct-bane](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=1041) [greater striking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [bastard sword](https://2e.aonprd.com/Weapons.aspx?ID=15)*. It uses an additional charge at the start of each of the user's turns while activated. It can be deactivated with an additional Interact free action. The first time in a round that an activated null blade strikes a creature or object, it consumes an additional charge and targets the struck creature or object with both *[dispel magic](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=78)* and *[discharge^](/Technology%20Guide#recharge)* with a counteract modifier of +23 and a Reflex save DC of 31. If an item with the [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech) trait damaged by a null blade is used in the same round it took damage, it glitches as if it had the [Timeworn^](/Traits/README.md#timeworn) trait.

## Rail Gun

**Level** 12; **Price** 2,400 gp; **Bulk** 3; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

This bulky rifle gives off a sickly green glow when fired. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A rail gun's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Frequency** once per round; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The rail gun compresses raw metal scrap using gravitons and accelerates them as they're fired through whatever they hit. The scrap is stopped if it cannot bypass the hardness, resistances, or immunities of a corporeal target in its path. Make a ranged Strike, treating the rail gun as an Advanced Firearm with the [Concussive](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=401) and [Fatal d12](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=178) traits, and compare the result to all creatures in a 200 foot line. The rail gun deals 3d10 piercing damage to all creatures and objects in the line whose AC is equal to or less than the result, ignoring the first 10 points of Hardness.

## Starfall Spade

**Level** 8; **Price** 500 gp; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Magical](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=103), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Base Weapon** [Monk's Spade^](#monks-spade)

These refined fusions of magic, advanced science, and masterful weaponsmithing are the signature tools for the guards of Starfall and the Palace of Fallen Stars.

A starfall spade's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry and the device automatically expends a single charge on a successful Strike to deal an additional point of electricity damage and an additional point of fire damage.

When not activated, a starfall spade gains the effects of a *[+1](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=281) [striking](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=280) [monk's spade^]*. You can't etch property runes into a starfall spade.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 5; **Effect** You press the crystal button on the shaft of the starfall spade to project a beam of plasma from the forked tip of the spade. Make a ranged Strike, treating the starfall spade as an Advanced Firearm with the [Plasma^](/Traits/README.md#plasma) critical specialization effects that deals 2d6 electricity damage and 2d6 fire damage with a range of 40 feet with no increment.

## Vortex Gun

**Level** 19; **Price** 40,000 gp; **Bulk** 3; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Force](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=75), [Incapacitation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=93), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

This sleek shotgun possesses three barrels arranged in a triangular formation. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A vortex gun's power is provided by [batteries^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges, while a vortex gun can hold three batteries. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Frequency** once per round; **Charges** 10; **Effect** The vortex gun's three barrels release beams of gravitons that swirl and spiral around each other creating a 100-foot cone of energy, dealing 15d10 force damage (basic Fortitude DC 41). On a failure, living creatures are sickened for 1 round. On a critical failure, living creatures are sickened for 1d6 rounds, confused for 1 round, and knocked prone. Flying creatures must attempt an Acrobatics check against the same DC to remain flying. A creature protected by a force field is unaffected by the vortex gun, but must attempt a DC 41 Reflex save or have its force field's remaining charges depleted.

## X-Laser

**Level** 13; **Price** 3,000 gp; **Bulk** 3; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

This heavy, super-charged laser rifle fires a highly focused, incredibly powerful beam of high-frequency light. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

An x-laser's power is provided by [batteries^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges, while an x-laser can hold two batteries. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Frequency** once per round; **Charges** 5; **Effect** The x-laser releases a powerful laser that bores through creatures and objects in its path. The beam is stopped if it cannot bypass the hardness, fire resistance, or fire immunity of a barrier or creature in its path. Make a ranged Strike, treating the x-laser as an Advanced Firearm, and compare the result to all creatures in a 200 foot line. The x-laser deals 3d12 fire damage to all creatures and objects in the line whose AC is equal to or less than the result. The resulting laser leaves a 1-inch diameter cauterized hole in the creatures and objects damaged by the x-laser as proof of its powerful discharge. Like other laser weapons, an x-laser's beam can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don't take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don't provide illumination.
