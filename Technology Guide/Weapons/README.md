A neural inhibitor is a 2-foot truncheon with multiple bands of metal along the head. A neural inhibitor can be activated with an Interact action by using a single charge, at which point its item bonus to attack rolls increases by 1 and it gains an additional damage die, though these effects are high-tech in nature, not magical. Additionally, while activated, creatures hit with the neural inhibitor must make a Fortitude save against your Class DC against the weapon's disorienting energy. On a failure, the target is stupefied 1 for one round. On a critical failure, the target is stupefied 2 for 1 round, and stupefied 1 for 1 minute. The neural inhibitor automatically Sustains the activation at the start of your turn using an additional charge, and can be deactivated with an additional Interact action.

If the target is wearing metal armor or has the metal trait, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your attack roll, and the target also takes 1d6 persistent electricity damage on a hit. On a critical hit, double the initial damage, but not the persistent damage.

## Autograpnel (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical, Advanced)

**Level** 4 (Timeworn, Commercial), 6 (Tactical), 8 (Advanced); **Price** 60 gp (Timeworn), 120 gp (Commercial), 240 gp (Tactical), 480 gp (Advanced); **Damage** 1d6 P (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical), 2d6 P (Advanced); **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 2; **Range** 60 feet

**Weapon Group** [Projectile^](/Traits/README.md#projectile); **Traits** Grapple, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech), Tethered, [Timeworn^](/Traits/README.md#timeworn) (Timeworn), [Tracking +1^](/Traits/README.md#tracking) (Tactical, Advanced)

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1; **Reload** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical, Advanced); **Upgrades** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

An autograpnel appears as a bulky rifle with an adamantine spike at the tip. It possesses 300 feet of coiled, metal cord between the spike and the rifle itself. While an autograpnel can be used as a Simple Ranged Weapon, its primary purpose is that of a high-tech grappling gun, and when used as such, has a usage of 1 charge when firing the spike and 1 charge when reeling in and reloading the spike. Reeling in and reloading the spike takes a single Interact action. When used as a weapon, you may attempt a Grapple check as a free action on a successful hit. You may then attempt to reel in the spike (using an Interact action and with a usage of 1 charge) along with your grappled target by attempting an Athletics check against the target's Fortitude DC (as if attempting a Shove, but pulling the target directly towards you rather than directly away from you). This is forced movement.

**Critical Success** You pull your target up to 10 feet towards you and continue grappling them.

**Success** You pull your target 5 feet towards you and continue grappling them.

**Failure** You do not move the target, but continue grappling them.

**Critical Failure** Your autograpnel releases the target and reloads.

**Capacity** 10 nanites; **Usage** 1; **Reload** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical, Advanced); **Upgrades** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical, Advanced)

Dart guns fire condensed needles of nanites at ranged targets. Dart guns possess small resevoirs above their handles into which a single dose of a pharmaceutical, drug, poison, or even a potion can be poured as an Interact action. The next dart fired from the dart gun delivers that liquid into the target immediately upon a hit.

## EMP Pistol (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical, Advanced)

**Level** 0 (Timeworn, Commercial), 2 (Tactical), 4 (Advanced); **Price** 9 gp (Timeworn), 18 gp (Commercial), 36 gp (Tactical), 100 gp (Advanced); **Damage** 1d8 E (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical), 2d8 E (Advanced); **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 1; **Range** 40 feet

**Capacity** -; **Usage** 1; **Reload** -; **Upgrades** -

A flare gun looks like a wide-barreled pistol, and although it can be used in combat, the item’s primary use is to send signals. A flare gun and its ammunition (a small, rocket-propelled magnesium charge) are completely self-contained and disposable—once fired, a flare gun is useless. The flare detonates once it hits a target or reaches its maximum range of 600 feet, bursting into a sphere of fire that illuminates a 120-foot-radius area for 1 minute as it drifts slowly back to the ground. Any creatures within 20 feet of the flare must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw each round or be dazzled by the intense light for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

**Capacity** 10 nanites; **Usage** 1; **Reload** - (Timeworn), 1 (Tactical, Advanced); **Upgrades** 1 (Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

This sleek, low-caliber rifle is made of a burnished skymetal. An id rifle fires tiny barbs of nanites that target the nervous system and possesses a microphone in its stock. A creature damaged by an id rifle must make a Will save against your Class DC. On a failure, the target is stupefied 1. On a critical failure, the target is stupefied 3. If the target is already stupefied, their stupefied value increases by the same amount. Additionally, as a command action that has a usage of 1, you can attempt to affect all creatures within 50 feet that have been damaged by your id rifle within the past 24 hours with a non-magical suggestion effect, using your Class DC.

# Martial Melee Weapons

## Chainsaw (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical, Advanced)

**Level** 2 (Timeworn, Commercial), 4 (Tactical), 6 (Advanced); **Price** 37 gp (Timeworn), 75 gp (Commercial), 150 gp (Tactical), 260 gp (Advanced); **Damage** 1d8 S (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical), 2d8 S (Advanced); **Bulk** 2; **Hands** 2

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** -; **Reload** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical, Advanced); **Upgrades** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

Originally developed for use as tools, chainsaws work remarkably well as weapons and are often used by lunatics or those who want to intimidate their enemies. A Numerian chainsaw consists of a weighty housing for the engine and power source that is fitted with two handles, and a 2- to 3-foot-long blade extending from the front, around which a whirling, buzzing chain of razorsharp cutting links spins at blinding speed when the weapon is activated. A chainsaw can be activated with an Interact action by using a single charge, at which point its item bonus to attack rolls increases by 1, it gains an additional damage die, and it is treated as having the [Wounding](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=309) rune, though these effects are high-tech in nature, not magical. You also take a -4 penalty on auditory Perception checks and on Stealth checks while the chainsaw is activated. An activated chainsaw uses 1 charge of power every hour, and continues to do so until either deactivated with an Interact action, it runs out of charges, or it is dropped (at which point it automatically deactivates).

## Monk's Spade

**Level** 0; **Price** 5; **Damage** 1d6 B; **Bulk** 1; **Hands**b 2

**Weapon Group** Polearm; **Traits** Monk, Versatile P or S

This polearm is a two-sided weapon. One side is fitted with a broad, shovel-like sharpened blade, while the opposite side is fitted with a crescent blade that juts out like a pair of bull’s horns. The type of damage it deals depends on how it is wielded, with the spade side able to bludgeon and slash and the crescent side able to slash and pierce.

**Capacity** 10 charges; **Usage** -; **Reload** 1; **Upgrades** 1 (Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

When activated with an Interact action, a plasma blade’s heavy, ornate handle projects a quantum field that contains energized plasma in a 2- to 3-foot-long “blade.” Activating a plasma blade has a usage of 1, and the plasma blade automatically uses an additional charge every minute while activated (an activated plasma blade can be deactivated with an additional Interact action). Half the damage a plasma blade deals is electricity and the other half is fire. Thanks to its quantum containment, a plasma blade is treated as dealing force damage when used against an incorporeal target.

## Stun Baton (Timeworn, Commercial, Tactical, Advanced)

**Capacity** 10 charges; **Usage** -; **Reload** - (Timeworn), 1 (Commercial, Tactical, Advanced); **Upgrades** - (Timeworm), 1 (Commercial, Tactical), 2 (Advanced)

This slender rod has an insulated grip and a conductive tip. All bludgeoning damage dealt by a stun baton is nonlethal. A stun baton can be activated with an Interact action by using a single charge, at which point it deals an additional 1d6 electricity damage which can be nonlethal or lethal (chosen when first activating the stun baton), though these effects are high-tech in nature, not magical. Additionally, while activated, creatures critically hit with the stun baton must make a Fortitude save against your Class DC against the weapon's stunning energy. On a failure, the target is stunned 1 for one round. On a critical failure, the target is stunned 2 for 1 round, and slowed 1 for 1 minute. The stun baton automatically Sustains the activation at the start of your turn using an additional charge, and can be deactivated with an additional Interact action.

# Special Technological Weaponry

The following technological weapons do not function as standard weapons, or are magically crafted pieces of weaponry that transcend the standard rules for technological items.

## Atom Gun

**Level** 18; **Price** 25,000 gp; **Bulk** 2; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Poison](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=126), [Radiation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=421), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)
 
An atom gun is a cruel weapon that harnesses the devastating energies of a miniaturized nuclear reactor to create a focused cone of radiation that blasts and sickens those caught in the beam. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

An atom gun has a miniaturized nuclear reactor inside powering it, and therefore does not require recharging from batteries like most high-tech items, but if the atom gun becomes broken, its power supply grows unreliable. In such a case, each time the atom gun is activated, the user must also succeed at a DC 5 flat check. Failure indicates that the gun's power supply fails and causes the gun to explode. This destroys the gun and subjects the wielder to high technological radiation. Additionally, if the gun is destroyed through other means, the gun's current wielder must make a successful DC 11 flat check to avoid having the gun explode in the same way. A destroyed atom gun becomes a constant source of radiation poisoning, affecting all creatures touching it with high technological radiation, creatures within 10 feet of it with medium technological radiation, and creatures within 30 feet of it with low technological radiation.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact (radiation); **Frequency** three times per day; **Effect** You fire the atom gun in a 40-foot cone. Creatures in the cone are affected by medium technological radiation. After the wielder resolves this activation, they take 1d6 points of fire damage from the atom gun heating up and beginning a cool-down protocol, during which the weapon cannot be fired for 1 minute.
 
## Death Ray

**Level** 18; **Price** 30,000 gp; **Bulk** 1; **Hands** 1

A death ray is a handheld, wand-like device that fires a harmless carrier beam of energy at a target. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A death ray's power is provided by a [nanite canister^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#nanite-canister). A full nanite canister has 10 charges. Charges are expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Effect** You turn the dial on the death ray, selecting the number of charges you wish to use when activating its secondary activation.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Frequency** once per turn; **Charges** 1+; **Effect** You fire the death ray at a creature within 200 feet, projecting a stream of specialized nanites through the beam into the body of the target. Make a ranged Strike, treating the death ray as an Advanced Firearm. On a success, the target must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be affected by a 9th-rank *disintegrate* effect. You can expend additional charges, up to a maximum of 10. For each additional charge spent beyond the first, the Fortitude save increases by 2, to a maximum of a DC of 38. A death ray does not affect non-living creatures (such as constructs or undead), nor can it penetrate a force field.

On a failure, living creatures are sickened for 1 round. On a critical failure, living creatures are sickened for 1d6 rounds, confused for 1 round, and knocked prone. Flying creatures must attempt an Acrobatics check against the same DC to remain flying. A creature protected by a force field is unaffected by the vortex gun, but must attempt a DC 41 Reflex save or have its force field's remaining charges depleted.

## X-Laser

**Level** 13; **Price** 3,000 gp; **Bulk** 3; **Hands** 2

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Frequency** once per round; **Charges** 5; **Effect** The x-laser releases a powerful laser that bores through creatures and objects in its path. The beam is stopped if it cannot bypass the hardness, fire resistance, or fire immunity of a barrier or creature in its path. Make a ranged Strike, treating the x-laser as an Advanced Firearm, and compare the result to all creatures in a 200 foot line. The x-laser deals 3d12 fire damage to all creatures and objects in the line whose AC is equal to or less than the result. The resulting laser leaves a 1-inch diameter cauterized hole in the creatures and objects damaged by the x-laser as proof of its powerful discharge. Like other laser weapons, an x-laser's beam can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don't take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don't provide illumination.
