# Technological Gear

New traits will be indicated with a carat (^) and are linked to their explanation.

## Access Card

**Traits** [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** Varies; **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

An access card is a small strip of stiff plastic with a colorcoded stripe on one side. Some access cards are further decorated with names or titles written in Androffan, or even photographs of long-dead crew members. An access card functions as a key—when swiped through an electronic lock as an Interact action, an access card unlocks any lock of its color code or a color code of a lower rating. Although access cards do not consume energy themselves, they work in only electronic locks that currently have power. Among certain societies in Numeria, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.

Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don’t work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another. Coding an access card for specific locks requires a lock coder. Some access cards could be worth far more than the prices listed above if they’re specifically encoded to locks that protect more valuable or significant contents.

## Battery

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 10 gp; **Bulk** L

A battery contains 10 charges when full. When recharging a battery at a generator, roll a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, the battery is destroyed and becomes a useless silverdisk.

## Chemalyzer

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 150 gp; **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

A chemalyzer is a handheld unit with an extendable wand tipped with a sampling nozzle. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A chemalyzer's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You dip the sampling nozzle into an alchemical or pharmaceutical item, gaining a +2 item bonus to your [Identify Alchemy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=44) and [Identify Pharmaceutical^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-pharmaceutical) checks. It cannot aid in the identification of magical effects or substances (like potions) but it does work on Alchemical Elixirs. A chemalyzer cannot be used in lieu of [Alchemist's tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2).

## E-pick

**Traits** [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

An e-pick (short for “electronic lock pick”) is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that a set of thieves’ tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices.

An e-pick's power is provided by a battery. A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [free action] Interact; **Trigger** You attempt to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock on a technological device; **Charges** 1; **Effect** Your e-pick powers up, guiding you through your Disable a Device or Pick a Lock check on a technological device. You gain an item bonus on the check based on the grade of e-pick, as detailed below.

Without expending a charge on an e-pick, [Pick a Lock](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=70) and [Disable a Device](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=69) checks on technological devices suffer a -5 penalty. Higher grade models of e-picks provide an item bonus to those checks. However, e-picks cannot be used on non-technological devices and they cannot substitute for regular picks in [Thieves' tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=58).

Grade     | Level | Item Bonus | Rarity   | Cost
----------|-------|------------|----------|-------
Brown     | 1     | 0          | Uncommon | 3 gp

## Emergency Beacon [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 55 gp; **Usage** structure; **Bulk** 2

**Capacity** 30; **Usage** 1 charge/8 hours

A DC 15 Track action can follow the beacon's signal.

## Filter Mask [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 250 gp; **Usage** worn mask; **Bulk** L

**Capacity** 10; **Usage** 1 charge/hour

Wearing the mask gives a +2 item bonus to all saving throws made to resist inhaled poisons and diseases even when not activated.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Usage** 1 charge/hour; **Effect** The creature wearing the mask becomes immune to all inhaled poisons and diseases.

## Flashlight [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Light](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=100), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 3 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** L

**Capacity** 10; **Usage** 1 charge/8 hours

A flashlight emits bright light in a 60 foot cone and dim light in the next 60 feet when activated.

## Goo Tube [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Consumable](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=36)

**Price** 3 sp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -

## Grenade [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Bomb](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=21), [Consumable](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=36), [Grenade^](/Traits/README.md#grenade), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Hands** 1; **Bulk** L

Grenades are explosives that can be thrown anywhere within 60 feet, with an area of effect as a 20-foot burst. However it is similar to beads on a *[necklace of fireballs](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=449)* where if it is a particularly difficult situation the GM may ask you to make an attack roll (treat as a bomb: martial proficiency with a 20 foot range increment).

Grenades need to be armed before activating, and go off at the start of the user's next turn after being primed - regardless if it has been thrown or not. When a grenade goes off, targets in the area of effect usually have to make a basic Reflex save; the DC and effect depends on the grenade.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Effect** You arm the grenade. It will activate at the start of your next turn, whether you have thrown it or not.

**Activate** [one action] Interact (ranged); **Effect** You toss the grenade at any area within 60 feet. If this action is disrupted - such as by a critical hit from an [Reactive Strike](http://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=8) - you drop the grenade on the ground directly beneath you.

Here is a list of the various kinds of grenades and their effects.

Grenade               | Level | Price  | Save DC       | Extra Traits      | Effect
----------------------|-------|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------
Arc Grenade           | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Electricity       | 5d6 electricity damage
Bang Grenade          | 3     | 15 gp  | Fort 23       | Auditory          | On a failure, creatures are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a critical failure, creature is deafened for 1 minute and stunned 1
Concussion Grenade    | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 bludgeoning damage
EMP Grenade           | 4     | 20 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Electricity       | 5d6 electricity damage to robots and tech with charges. Half to androids and cyborgs. No damage to other creatures
Flash Grenade         | 1     | 5 gp   | Fort 20       | Light, Visual     | Creatures are blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute. Creatures blinded this way can spend 1 interact action rubbing their eyes to end the blinded condition

Soft Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 22  | Nonlethal         | 5d6 bludgeoning damage. This effect has the nonlethal trait
Zero Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Cold              | 5d6 cold damage

## Grippers [STILL UPDATING]

**Level** 1; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L

Grippers can be used like a crowbar, negating the -2 item penalty to pry something open without one. To pull apart two items attached together with Grippers requires a DC 22 Athletics check.

Grippers can also be used in combat.

**Activate** [two actions] Interact; **Effect** Make a Strike, treating the grippers as an improvised weapon. On a successful hit, the grippers deal 1d4+7 points of bludgeoning damage.

## Ion Tape [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 3; **Price** 15 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** L

When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Escape check to break.

## Medlance [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** Uncommon, Injection, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 30 gp; **Hands** 1; **Bulk** -

A medlance doesn't use electrical charges, but after 10 uses its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and it becomes useless.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact or Strike; **Effect** You inject the liquid in the medlance into the target. If the target is unwilling, make a Strike against their AC (treat the medlance as a simple one-handed melee weapon). On a hit you do no damage, but the liquid is injected. This changes the ingested trait on poisons to the injury trait.

## Nanite Canister [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** Rare, Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 30 gp; **Bulk** L

## Nanite Hypogun [STILL UPDATING]

All nanite hypoguns have two settings.

**Activate** (1 action) Interact; **Nanite Use** 1 charge; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its primary setting. The target recovers hit points according to the Primary column of the table below.

**Activate** varies, usually 10 minutes; **Nanite Use** 5 charges; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its secondary setting. This has the effect listed in the Secondary column of the table below.

## Skillchip [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge concerning a single Lore skill, granting an item bonus to checks made using that skill. It must be slotted into a [skillslot](../Cybertech/README.md#skillslot) before it can provide the benefits. All skillchips have negligible bulk.

Model    | Level | Cost   | Bonus | Rarity   | Craft DC
---------|-------|--------|-------|----------|---------

A trauma pack can be used as [Healer's Tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=25) for the sake of making [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) checks, but if a use is expended the patient is not temporarily immune to further [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) actions made using trauma pack charges.

You cannot use a trauma pack in this fashion for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set above 20.

**Traits** Rare, Healing, [Pharmaceutical^](/Traits/README.md#pharmaceutical)

**Level** 9; **Price** 800 gp; **Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1; **Uses** 5

As the trauma pack, but a charge can be also expended to bring a creature that died in the last minute back to life. A creature brought back this way has no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body, but persistent damage is removed.

Trauma pack plus uses can be expended like a trauma pack use for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set up to 30.

## Veemod [STILL UPDATING]

**Traits** Rare, [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)
