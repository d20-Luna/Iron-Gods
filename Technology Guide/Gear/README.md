## Access Card

**Traits** [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** Varies; **Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

An access card is a small strip of stiff plastic with a colorcoded stripe on one side. Some access cards are further decorated with names or titles written in Androffan, or even photographs of long-dead crew members. An access card functions as a key—when swiped through an electronic lock as an Interact action, an access card unlocks any lock of its color code or a color code of a lower rating. Although access cards do not consume energy themselves, they work in only electronic locks that currently have power. Among certain societies in Numeria, access cards are also used as decorations, worn as affectations, and incorporated into ceremonial regalia.

Access cards must be encoded to specific locks before they can function. Often, all of the doors in a complex are keyed to a unique set of cards that don’t work on doors found in other complexes, much like a skeleton key might open all the doors in one castle but none in another. Coding an access card for specific locks requires a lock coder. Some access cards could be worth far more than the prices listed above if they’re specifically encoded to locks that protect more valuable or significant contents.

## Battery

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 10 gp; **Bulk** L

A battery contains 10 charges when full. When recharging a battery at a generator, roll a DC 4 flat check. On a failure, the battery is destroyed and becomes a useless silverdisk.

## Camera

## Chemalyzer

**Traits** [Rare](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=137), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 150 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** 1

A chemalyzer is a handheld unit with an extendable wand tipped with a sampling nozzle. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A chemalyzer's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You dip the sampling nozzle into an alchemical or pharmaceutical item, gaining a +2 item bonus to your [Identify Alchemy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=44) and [Identify Pharmaceutical^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-pharmaceutical) checks. It cannot aid in the identification of magical effects or substances (like potions) but it does work on Alchemical Elixirs. A chemalyzer cannot be used in lieu of [Alchemist's tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=2).

## Commset

## E-pick

**Traits** [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

An e-pick (short for “electronic lock pick”) is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that a set of thieves’ tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices.

An e-pick's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [free action] Interact; **Trigger** You attempt to Disable a Device or Pick a Lock on a technological device; **Charges** 1; **Effect** Your e-pick powers up, guiding you through your Disable a Device or Pick a Lock check on a technological device. You gain an item bonus on the check based on the grade of e-pick, as detailed below.

Without expending a charge on an e-pick, [Pick a Lock](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=70) and [Disable a Device](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=69) checks on technological devices suffer a -5 penalty. Higher grade models of e-picks provide an item bonus to those checks. However, e-picks cannot be used on non-technological devices and they cannot substitute for regular picks in [Thieves' tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=58).

Grade     | Level | Item Bonus | Rarity   | Cost
----------|-------|------------|----------|-------
Brown     | 1     | 0          | Uncommon | 3 gp
Black     | 3     | +1         | Uncommon | 15 gp

## Emergency Beacon

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Signal^](/Traits/README.md#signal), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 55 gp

**Usage** structure; **Bulk** 2

An emergency beacon is a small, pod-shaped device with a bright red dome on its top. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

An emergency beacon's power is provided by [batteries^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges, and an emergency beacon can hold three batteries. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You flip a switch on the beacon, transmitting its location, while the red dome on its top begins to illuminate. Any device capable of receiving signals of any sort can pick up a beacon’s signal, which can then be tracked back to the source with a DC 15 Track action. A beacon’s transmissions have a range of 100 miles over flat terrain, but this range is halved in forests or hills, and quartered in mountainous terrain or through water. The emergency beacon uses an additional charge every eight hours while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.

## Filter Mask

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 6; **Price** 250 gp

**Usage** worn mask; **Bulk** L

This clear mask grants its wearer a +2 item bonus to all saving throws made to resist inhaled poisons and diseases even when not activated, thanks to its built in air filters. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A filter mask's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The creature wearing the mask becomes immune to all inhaled poisons and diseases. The mask consumes an additional charge every hour that it is activated, and can be deactivated with another Interact action.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The flashlight emits bright light in a 60 foot cone and dim light in the next 60 feet when activated. A flashlight has no effect in areas of magical darkness. The flashlight uses an additional charge every eight hours while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.

## Force Field

## Goo Tube

**Traits** [Consumable](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=36)

**Price** 3 sp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** -

The contents of a single goo tube can provide nourishment for a day for one Medium-size creature.

## Grenade

**Traits** [Uncommon](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=159), [Bomb](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=21), [Consumable](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=36), [Grenade^](/Traits/README.md#grenade), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

Grenades are explosives that can be thrown anywhere within 60 feet, with an area of effect as a 20-foot burst. However it is similar to beads on a *[necklace of fireballs](http://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=449)* where if it is a particularly difficult situation the GM may ask you to make an attack roll (treat as a bomb: martial proficiency with a 20 foot range increment).

Grenades need to be armed before activating, and go off at the start of the user's next turn after being primed - regardless if it has been thrown or not. When a grenade goes off, targets in the area of effect usually have to make a basic Reflex save; the DC and effect depends on the grenade.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Effect** You arm the grenade. It will activate at the start of your next turn, whether you have thrown it or not.

**Activate** [one action] Interact (ranged); **Effect** You toss the grenade at any area within 60 feet. If this action is disrupted - such as by a critical hit from an [Reactive Strike](http://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=8) - you drop the grenade on the ground directly beneath you.

Here is a list of the various kinds of grenades and their effects.

Grenade               | Level | Price  | Save DC       | Extra Traits      | Effect
----------------------|-------|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------
Arc Grenade           | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Electricity       | 5d6 electricity damage
Bang Grenade          | 3     | 15 gp  | Fort 23       | Auditory          | On a failure, creatures are deafened until the end of their next turn. On a critical failure, creature is deafened for 1 minute and stunned 1
Concussion Grenade    | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 bludgeoning damage
EMP Grenade           | 4     | 20 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Electricity       | 5d6 electricity damage to robots and tech with charges. Half to androids and cyborgs. No damage to other creatures
Flash Grenade         | 1     | 5 gp   | Fort 20       | Light, Visual     | Creatures are blinded for 1 round and dazzled for 1 minute. Creatures blinded this way can spend 1 interact action rubbing their eyes to end the blinded condition
Flechette Grenade     | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 piercing damage
Fragmentation Grenade | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  |                   | 5d6 slashing damage
Inferno Grenade       | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Fire              | 5d6 fire damage
Soft Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 22  | Nonlethal         | 5d6 bludgeoning damage. This effect has the nonlethal trait
Zero Grenade          | 5     | 25 gp  | basic Ref 20  | Cold              | 5d6 cold damage

## Grippers

**Level** 1; **Price** 15 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

Grippers can be used like a crowbar, negating the -2 item penalty to pry something open without one. To pull apart two items attached together with Grippers requires a DC 22 Athletics check.

Grippers can also be wielded in combat as an improvised weapon, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

## Ion Tape

**Traits** Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 3; **Price** 15 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** L

A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a [zipstick](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#zipstick)), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Escape check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many; it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.

## Magboots

## Medlance

**Traits** Uncommon, Injection, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 30 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** -

This wand-like device contains a reservoir at one end and a small pad at the other.

A medlance doesn't use electrical charges, but after 10 uses its internal sterilization mechanisms are depleted and it becomes useless.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Effect** You fill the medlance with a single dose of liquid, such as a pharmaceutical, a potion, or a poison.

**Activate** [one action] Interact or Strike; **Effect** You inject the liquid in the medlance into the target. If the target is unwilling, make a Strike against their AC (treat the medlance as a simple one-handed melee weapon). On a hit you do no damage, but the liquid is injected. This changes the ingested trait on poisons to the injury trait.

## Nanite Canister

**Traits** Rare, Consumable, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 30 gp

**Bulk** L

A nanite canister is used to power technological devices that use nanites—such items generally don’t require other sources of power, as the nanites themselves do the bulk of the work when the object is activated. The canister contains a small, independent power source and a supply of nanites. A single canister contains enough nanites to provide 10 charges for a nanotech item or weapon.

## Nanite Hypogun

**Traits** Rare, Healing, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This bizarre metal pistol-like object has a needle at the end instead of a barrel. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A nanite hypogun's power is provided by a [nanite canister^](#nanite-canister). A full nanite canister has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its primary setting. The target recovers hit points according to the Primary column of the table below.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 5; **Effect** You inject the target with the nanite hypogun using its secondary setting. This has the effect listed in the Secondary column of the table below.

Color Grade | Level | Cost      | Primary | Secondary
------------|-------|-----------|---------|-----------
Brown       | 2     | 30 gp     | 1d8+1   | +2 to saving throws against poison & disease for the next 8 hours
Black       | 5     | 180 gp    | 2d8+3   | Casts *[restoration](http://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=258)*

## Power Receiver

## Radiation Detector

**Traits** Rare, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Level** 5; **Price** 120 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

This device looks like a fancy magnifying glass. It's glass portion glows in various colors once powered on. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A radiation detector's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully powered battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The device begins to measure and display radiation levels in a 120-foot-radius circle around the user, as the *[detect radiation^]* spell. The device makes a soft clicking sound that changes in volume and frequency according to the radiation level encountered, and the small screen at the top indicates the approximate source and strength of radiation in these areas, with red areas indicating severe radiation, yellow high radiation, green medium radiation, and blue low radiation. Areas with less radiation don't register on the device's screen. The device uses 1 charge of power every hour, and continues to do so until deactivated with an Interact action or it runs out of charges.

## Skillchip

**Traits** [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Usage** installed in skillslot

A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge concerning a single Lore skill, granting an item bonus to checks made using that skill. It must be slotted into a skillslot before it can provide the benefits. All skillchips have negligible bulk.

Model    | Level | Cost   | Bonus | Rarity
---------|-------|--------|-------|----------
Mark I   | 2     | 25 gp  | +1    | Uncommon
Mark II  | 4     | 95 gp  | +2    | Rare

## Trauma Pack

**Traits** Uncommon, Healing

**Level** 4; **Price** 30 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1

This small box of emergency medical equipment is essential in Numerian medical facilities. A trauma pack can be used as [Healer's Tools](https://2e.aonprd.com/Equipment.aspx?ID=25) for the sake of making [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) checks, but if a use is expended the patient is not temporarily immune to further [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) actions made using trauma pack uses. A trauma pack can be used in this manner five times before it becomes a standard set of healer's tools.

You cannot use a trauma pack in this fashion for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set above 20.

## Trauma Pack Plus

**Traits** Rare, Healing

**Level** 9; **Price** 800 gp

**Usage** held in 2 hands; **Bulk** 1

As the trauma pack, but a charge can be also expended to bring a creature that died in the last minute back to life. A creature brought back this way has no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and still with any long-term debilitations of the old body, but persistent damage is removed.

Trauma pack plus uses can be expended like a trauma pack use for [Treat Wounds](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=57) DCs set up to 30.

## Veemod

**Traits** Rare, [Module^](/Traits/README.md#module), [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

Veemods slot into [Veemod Goggles](#veemod-goggles) and are useless without them. All veemods have negligible bulk.

Color Grade | Level | Cost      | Charges | Benefit

## Veemod Goggles

**Traits** Uncommon, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 60 gp

**Usage** worn eyepiece; **Bulk** -

These goggles come in a variety of colors and shapes, but most are sleek and streamlined in appearance. The primary use for these goggles is to enhance vision via the application of a “vision enhancement module,” or “[veemod^](#veemod).” A pair of veemod goggles can be fitted with only one veemod at a time; attaching a veemod is an Interact action. This Numerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A pair of veemod goggles's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You flip a switch on the goggles, activating it based on its installed veemod. If a veemod is not installed, it fails to activate. The veemod goggles use an additional charge at an interval based on the grade of veemod installed, and can be deactivated with an Interact action.

## Zipstick

**Traits** [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Price** 3 gp

**Usage** held in 1 hand; **Bulk** L

A zipstick is a small pen-like device used to administer a small jolt of electricity. This NUmerian item's effects are high-tech in nature, not magical.

A zipstick's power is provided by a [battery^](#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You administer a small jolt of electricity to the target and potentially activate it. If the target is a creature, make a Strike using the zipstick as an improvised weapon, on a hit it deals 1 electricity damage.
