# Light Armor

## Deep Diving Suit

**Level** 12; **Price** 1,850 gp; **AC Bonus** +3; **Dex Cap** +5; **Check Penalty** -1; **Speed Penalty** —

**Strength** +1; **Bulk** 1; **Traits** Aquadynamic, Flexible, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1/hour; **Upgrades** 3

This body-tight mesh of reinforced rubber and polymer is outfitted with scrubbers that draw and purify oxygen from the environment, even extracting oxygen from water as easily as air. A deep diving suit does not require activation to draw and purify oxygen; charges are expended automatically every hour.

The wearer of a deep diving suit treats the environmental damage from water pressure as one step less severe (moderate as minor, minor as negligible, etc). Additionally, the suit filters oxygen out of the surrounding water and clouds, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater and be immune to inhaled toxins, as long as the suit has power.

A deep diving suit's hands and feet contain webbing, long fins, and flippers, which the wearer can extend (and retract) as an Interact action. While in this mode, the wearer of the suit gains a swim speed of 20 feet and a +3 item bonus on Athletics checks to Swim, but the armor check penalty of the suit doubles to –4 and the wearer takes a -10 foot penalty to their land speed.

The activated suit also grants a +3 item bonus to the wearer's Fortitude DC and Reflex DC against shove and trip attempts and a +3 item bonus on Reflex saves against Trample attempts, and slows any fall as if the wearer were under the effect of a *[gentle landing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=111)* spell. The suit uses an additional charge every hour while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The gravity suit begins repelling matter from below, granting its wearer a fly speed of 60 feet. The suit uses an additional charge every minute while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The smart armor quickly expands to cover the wearer’s legs and limbs, and a built-in magnetic generator hardens the armor into a rigid, plate-like form. When in this form, it gains the statistics of its extended form [it becomes Heavy Armor, its bonus to AC increases to +6, its Max Dex decreases to +0, its Check Penalty increases to -3, its Speed Penalty increases to -10 feet, its Strength Requirement increases to +4, its Bulk increases to 2, and it gains the Bulwark trait), and expends an additional charge every 10 minutes. It can be collapsed back to its compact form with a single Interact action, and automatically retracts when it loses power. In either form, smart armor provides resistance 2 to physical damage due to its adamantine construction.
 
# Medium Armor

## HEV Suit

**Level** 15; **Price** 6,250 gp; **AC Bonus** +4; **Max Dex** 3; **Check Penalty** -2; **Speed Penalty** -5 feet

**Strength** +3; **Bulk** 2; **Traits** Bulwark, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

Short for “hazardous environment,” an HEV suit provides protection from radiation, disease, poisonous gas, cold, heat, and similar environmental dangers. The suit needs a power supply to work and charges are consumed automatically each hour — while deactivated, none of the following abilities function at all.

While powered, the suit provides immunity to inhaled poisons and diseases, and provides resistance 10 against all forms of energy except for sonic damage. An HEV suit completely protects against low radiation, and reduces the effects of medium radiation to low radiation, but it offers no protection against high or severe radiation. The suit’s self-repairing polymer resin fabric automatically seals secondary punctures or tears created by physical attacks to the wearer and damage dealt specifically against the suit. It repairs damage to itself at the rate of 2d6 points of damage per charge consumed. While repairing damage in this manner, the suit’s other protective functions listed above are any taken offline. An HEV suit has hardness 2 and 30 hit points.
 
## Nanite Ablative Armor [STILL UPDATING]

This suit of armor consists of several layers of scaly mesh over a thick, clothlike polymer weave. When activated with a single Interact action, a suit of nanite ablative armor grants the wearer additional protection against nanites, through the use of imperceptible magnetic fields that repel the microscopic robots. An active suit of nanite ablative armor grants a +3 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC and saving throws against creatures, items, and effects composed of or powered via nanites (such as via a nanite canister). This does not grant the bonuses against androids.
 
## Panic Suit [STILL UPDATING]

Before activation, a panic suit is a fist-sized plastic sphere. A panic suit has its own internal power source with 10 charges. It does not require batteries to function.
