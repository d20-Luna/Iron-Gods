# Light Armor

## Deep Diving Suit

**Level** 12; **Price** 1,850 gp; **AC Bonus** +3; **Dex Cap** +5; **Check Penalty** -1; **Speed Penalty** —

**Strength** +1; **Bulk** 1; **Traits** Aquadynamic, Flexible, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1/hour; **Upgrades** 3

This body-tight mesh of reinforced rubber and polymer is outfitted with scrubbers that draw and purify oxygen from the environment, even extracting oxygen from water as easily as air. A deep diving suit does not require activation to draw and purify oxygen; charges are expended automatically every hour.

The wearer of a deep diving suit treats the environmental damage from water pressure as one step less severe (moderate as minor, minor as negligible, etc). Additionally, the suit filters oxygen out of the surrounding water and clouds, allowing the wearer to breathe underwater and be immune to inhaled toxins, as long as the suit has power.

A deep diving suit's hands and feet contain webbing, long fins, and flippers, which the wearer can extend (and retract) as an Interact action. While in this mode, the wearer of the suit gains a swim speed of 20 feet and a +3 item bonus on Athletics checks to Swim, but the armor check penalty of the suit doubles to –4 and the wearer takes a -10 foot penalty to their land speed.
 
## Gravity Suit

**Level** 14; **Price** 3,850 gp; **AC Bonus** +0; **Dex Cap** +8; **Check Penalty** —; **Speed Penalty** —

**Strength** +0; **Bulk** L; **Traits** Comfort, Flexible, Force, [Tech^](/Traits.README.md#tech)

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** Varies; **Upgrades** 4

A gravity suit consists of several black, flexible straps attached to a framework of delicate servos, thin plates, and small strips of black polymer plastic—this give it an appearance of being ineffective armor.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The suit generates a field of gravitons around the wearer, increasing the armor's AC bonus to +5. The activated suit also grants a +3 item bonus to the wearer's Fortitude DC and Reflex DC against shove and trip attempts and a +3 item bonus on Reflex saves against Trample attempts, and slows any fall as if the wearer were under the effect of a *[gentle landing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=111)* spell. The suit uses an additional charge every hour while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The gravity suit begins repelling matter from below, granting its wearer a fly speed of 60 feet. The suit uses an additional charge every minute while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.
 
## Heavy Weapon Harness

This padded jumpsuit is made of resilient polymers interwoven with superconducting thread. It provides modest protection from conventional and energy weapons. The wearer gains the item's AC bonus to their Fortitude and Reflex saving throws against effects that deal acid, cold, and electricity damage. In addition, the inssuit provides resistance 5 against acid, cold, and electricity.
 
## Neraplast Armor

**Level** 4; **Price** 100 gp; **AC Bonus** +1; **Max Dex +4**; **Check Penalty** -1; **Speed Penalty** —

**Strength** +0; **Bulk** 1; **Traits** Comfort, Flexible, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1; **Upgrades** 2

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** You change the colour of the neraplast armour to match your surroundings. You gain a +2 item bonus to Sneak and Hide as long as you're within the current terrain. Moving outside of the terrain requires you to recalibrate its colour again.

## Scatterlight Suit

**Capacity** 60 charges; **Usage** 1; **Upgrades** 3

Before activation, a suit of smart armor resembles an intricate breastplate of adamantine scales.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The smart armor quickly expands to cover the wearer’s legs and limbs, and a built-in magnetic generator hardens the armor into a rigid, plate-like form. When in this form, it gains the statistics of its extended form [it becomes Heavy Armor, its bonus to AC increases to +6, its Max Dex decreases to +0, its Check Penalty increases to -3, its Speed Penalty increases to -10 feet, its Strength Requirement increases to +4, its Bulk increases to 4, and it gains the Bulwark trait), and expends an additional charge every 10 minutes. It can be collapsed back to its compact form with a single Interact action, and automatically retracts when it loses power. In either form, smart armor provides resistance 2 to physical damage due to its adamantine construction.
 
# Medium Armor

## HEV Suit

**Level** 15; **Price** 6,250 gp; **AC Bonus** +4; **Max Dex** 3; **Check Penalty** -2; **Speed Penalty** -5 feet

**Strength** +3; **Bulk** 2; **Traits** Bulwark, [Tech^](/Traits/README.md#tech)

Short for “hazardous environment,” an HEV suit provides protection from radiation, disease, poisonous gas, cold, heat, and similar environmental dangers. The suit needs a power supply to work and charges are consumed automatically each hour — while deactivated, none of the following abilities function at all.

While powered, the suit provides immunity to inhaled poisons and diseases, and provides resistance 10 against all forms of energy except for sonic damage. An HEV suit completely protects against low radiation, and reduces the effects of medium radiation to low radiation, but it offers no protection against high or severe radiation. The suit’s self-repairing polymer resin fabric automatically seals secondary punctures or tears created by physical attacks to the wearer and damage dealt specifically against the suit. It repairs damage to itself at the rate of 2d6 points of damage per charge consumed. While repairing damage in this manner, the suit’s other protective functions listed above are any taken offline. An HEV suit has hardness 2 and 30 hit points.

**Capacity** 20 charges; **Usage** 1/hour; **Upgrades** 3

This suit of armor consists of several layers of scaly mesh over a thick, clothlike polymer weave. When activated with a single Interact action, a suit of nanite ablative armor grants the wearer additional protection against nanites, through the use of imperceptible magnetic fields that repel the microscopic robots. An active suit of nanite ablative armor grants a +3 circumstance bonus to the wearer's AC and saving throws against creatures, items, and effects composed of or powered via nanites (such as via a nanite canister). This does not grant the bonuses against androids.

While activated, it provides immunity to low radiation and resistance 5 against all forms of energy except sonic damage. Its air filters grant a +2 status bonus on saving throws against inhaled poisons and diseases. The panic suit uses an additional charge every hour while activated, and can be deactivated with an Interact action.

A panic suit is a single-use item. When its charges run out or its wearer deactivates it, it falls apart into useless fragments.

Powered armor represents the pinnacle of personal armor; a suit crafted of multiple skymetals and other materials designed to augment the wearer in numerous ways. A suit of powered armor consumes charges automatically at a rate of one charge per hour. When deactivated, a suit of powered armor locks up and the wearer must be removed from a deactivated with assistance over the course of 1 minute, as the wearer is fully locked within the armor.

The armor actually boosts land speed when worn, granting a +10 foot item bonus to the wearer’s speed. While worn, powered armor also grants a +3 item bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks. Powered armor protects against energy and the environment as if it were a [spacesuit^](#spacesuit). Powered armor has hardness 20 and 300 hit points. Powered armor is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly speed of 60 feet in areas of no gravity and 20 feet in gravity.

The wearer of a suit of powered armor may activate the armor’s self-repair system with an Interact action. The armor consumes a single charge and repairs 2d6 points of damage. Only 1 charge can be consumed per turn for this effect.

In addition, the following technological wonders are integrated into a suit of powered armor; each of these devices drains power from the suit’s charges as appropriate when they are activated and used.
* [Camera^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#camera) in the helmet.
* [Commset^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#commset) in the helmet.
