## Baseline

**Level** 5; **Price** 150 gp

A synthetic blend of neuroinhibitors fortifies the mind. A creature injected with baseline is immune to mental effects for 1 hour.

## Cardioamp

**Additional Traits** Drug, Healing, Poison

**Level** 9; **Price** 250 gp

A synthetic blend of adrenaline restarts hearts and stops them.

When administered to a creature that has died in the past minute, the creature can immediately attempt a DC20 Fortitude saving throw. On a success, the creature returns to life, stabilized at 0 HP.

The creature returns to life with no spells prepared or spell slots available, no points in any pools or any other daily resources, and with any long-term debilitations of the old body. They are also clumsy 2, drained 2 and enfeebled 2 for 1 day.

A living creature injected with cardioamp must make a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw.

**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.

**Success** The creature becomes sickened 1.

**Failure** The creature becomes drained 2 and sickened 1.

**Critical Failure** The creature goes into cardiac arrest. They take 3d6 poison damage and become stunned 2 and drained 2.

## Cureall

**Additional Traits** Healing

**Level** 8; **Price** 85 gp

A synthetic blend of antibiotics clense the body.

A dose of Cureall allows the target to attempt an additional saving throw against a single disease or poison affliction currently affecting them, regardless of whether the stage of the affliction has passed yet.

Cureall also lowers the value of the target's clumsy, drained, enfeebled and stupefied conditions by 1.

## Hemochem

**Additional Traits** Healing

A synthetic blend of blood thickeners ends persistent bleed effects and grants accelerated healing.

Five grades of hemochem exist; the fast healing granted by a dose depends on the pharmaceuticalâ€™s grade, as detailed below.

Grade | Level | Cost   | Rarity   | Fast Healing Granted
------|-------|--------|----------|----------------------
I     | 4     | 20 gp  | Uncommon | Fast Healing 1
II    | 5     | 30 gp  | Uncommon | Fast Healing 2
III   | 6     | 55 gp  | Uncommon | Fast Healing 3
IV    | 7     | 75 gp  | Rare     | Fast Healing 4
V     | 8     | 100 gp | Rare     | Fast Healing 5

## Torpinol

**Additional Traits** Ingested, Mental, Poison

**Level** 4; **Price** 18 gp

A synthetic blend of psychoactive compounds that forces honesty.

Each additional dose administered during this one-minute onset time forces a new Will save, with the DC increasing by 2 to a maximum of 28.

**Saving Throw** DC 18 Will; **Maximum Duration** 10 minutes; **Onset** 1 minute
    * **Success** Torpinal does not affect the target.
    * **Failure** When the target speaks, they must tell the truth.
    * **Critical Failure** As failure, and when someone asks the target a question, they must attempt another Will save at the DC of the roll they failed at. If they fail this saving throw, they must answer the question truthfully if they are able to do so; if they succeed, they are temporarily immune to further attempts to ask the same question within the pharmaceutical's duration.

## Vive

**Additional Traits** Drug, Ingested

**Level** 2; **Price** 25 gp

A synthetic blend of medicinal compounds revitalizes the body at the cost of mental acuity. It eliminated the target's clumsy, drained, and enfeebled conditions.

**Saving Throw** DC 18 Fortitude; **Maximum Duration** 24 hours; **Stage 1** stupified 1 (24 hours); **Stage 2** stupified 2 (24 hours); **Stage 3** stupified 3 (24 hours)

## Zortaphen

**Additional Traits** Drug, Incapacitation, Injury, Sleep

**Level** 5; **Price** 145 gp

A powerful, synthetic blend of numbing agents.

Zortaphen is a powerful anesthetic. A creature that takes a dose of zortaphen must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw or become unconscious for 1 hour; the unconsciousness takes effect 1d6 rounds after the failed save. A creature under the effects of zortaphen is numbed as well, making it immune to pain effects while sleeping. Damage inflicted on someone put to sleep with zortaphen does not cause the sleeper to awaken. Awakening someone early requires a successful DC 21 Medicine (Expert) check and an Interact action.

Zortaphen can be dangerous if too much is taken at once. A skilled character can use a successful DC 19 Medicine check to keep someone under the effects of zortaphen unconscious indefinitely by injecting a new dose every hour. On a failed Medicine check or if a second dose is administered without attempting a Medicine check, a victim already under the effects of zortaphen must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw, with the DC increasing by 2 for each additional dose administers before the first expires.
    * **Success** The zortaphen does not affect the target.
    * **Failure** The target becomes drained 1 for 24 hours (or has its drained condition increase by 1 stage and the duration increased to 24 hours).
    * **Critical Failure** The target becomes drained 2 for 24 hours (or has its drained condition increase by 2 stages and has its duration increased to 24 hours).
