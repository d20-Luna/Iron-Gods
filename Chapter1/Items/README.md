This open-faced, blue polymer helmet includes a nylon strap and adjustable tinted visor capable of hiding all but the wearerâ€™s mouth and chin.

A proximity helmet's power is provided by a [battery^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear#battery). A fully charged battery has 10 charges. A charge is expended whenever the device is activated, as detailed below in its "Charges" entry.

**Activate** [one action] Interact; **Charges** 1; **Effect** The interior of the tinted visor lights up, and display nearby movement as blips on its heads-up display, granting the wearer a +2 status bonus on Perception checks to notice moving targets within 60 feet. Additionally, an activated proximity helmet produces a loud chirping sound near the wearer's ears whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet. This sound is loud enough to wake the wearer from sleep, but not loud enough to wake nearby creatures. The helmet uses an additional charge each hour while activated. It can be deactivated with another Interact action.
