## General Traits

### Tech

Weapons with the tech trait incorporate electronics, computer systems, and power sources. Sometimes the weapons use such little energy that they can rely on integrated power sources (such as melee weapons that don’t have a magazine), while others drain batteries with attacks. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) don’t function on these weapons.

Creatures with the tech trait are powered by or constructed through technological means, and are affected by effects that specifically target technology such as *[rebuke technology^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#rebuke-technology)*. Most Robots have the tech trait, but Androids do not.

Hazards or other devices with the tech trait impose a -5 penalty on all Disable a Device checks against it if the creature making the check does not use an [e-pick^](Gear/README.md#e-pick) charge in the attempt.

## Equipment Traits

### Aeon

You can fit one aeon stone or spell gem into this weapon as a single action with the interact trait. While you possess the weapon with an aeon stone in it, you gain all the benefits of the aeon stone as if it were orbiting your head. While the weapon has a spell gem attached, you gain a number of bonus battery charges equal to the spell gem’s item level × 5. These charges regenerate during your daily preparations. In addition, you can use the spell gem while wielding the weapon, though using the gem in this manner still destroys it.

### Analog

This weapon eschews advanced electronics, computers systems, and electric power sources, but was manufactured and calibrated using advanced technology. This weapon is immune to abilities that target technology. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) don’t function on this weapon unless this weapon also has the archaic trait.

### Archaic

This weapon is crafted using traditional methods and materials but is not suitable for striking tech armor. All weapons from Pathfinder Second Edition have the archaic trait. Weapon runes (as found in Pathfinder) function normally with archaic weapons.

### Arc

The attack arcs to the closest enemy creature within 10 feet of the initial target. If the secondary target’s AC is lower than your attack roll result, you deal electricity damage to that creature equal to 1 per weapon damage die.

### Area (burst, cone, line)

Weapons with this trait can only fire using the Area Fire action.

**Area Fire** [two actions] (area, attack) You target each creature in the designated area with a range equal to the weapon’s range increment (for cone or line) or the designated radius of the explosion (for burst). For burst, you can position the center point anywhere within your first range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a basic Reflex save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don’t roll an attack roll). This damage is area damage. Creatures that critically fail this save are subject to effects that occur on a critical hit with this weapon, including the weapon’s critical specialization effect.

### Automatic

In addition to a normal Strike, you can fire this weapon using the Automatic Fire action.

**Automatic Fire** [two actions] (area, attack) You hit each creature in a cone with a range equal to half the weapon’s range increment. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a basic Reflex save against your class DC plus the tracking value of the weapon (you don’t roll an attack roll). This damage is area damage. Creatures that critically fail this save are subject to effects that occur on a critical hit with this weapon, including the weapon’s critical specialization effect. Automatic Fire has a usage equal to half the weapon’s maximum capacity.

### Capacity

Most weapons take batteries or have magazines to allow for multiple shots. The capacity of a weapon indicates how much ammunition it can hold. Charges represent battery-powered weapons and the highest capacity battery it can hold. Many flame weapons instead utilize petrol, which is sold in tanks and otherwise functions as batteries. Most projectile weapons use magazines, which can hold a maximum number of cartridges. Depending on the weapon, cartridges could be bolts, darts, flechettes, rounds, or other ammunition. Most projectile weapons use rounds, while most injection weapons use darts. Cartridges are purchased individually, at a cost of 10 cartridges per gold. Note that this is separate from than the capacity trait presented on page 150 of Pathfinder Guns & Gears.

### Caster

This weapon can be powered by casting a spell (including a cantrip) with two or more actions. If you do, resolve the spell normally. Once the spell is cast, if it had the acid, cold, fire, electricity, spirit, sonic, vitality, or void trait, the weapon deals damage of that type instead of its usual damage until the end of your next turn or until you cast another spell. If the spell deals more than one type of damage, choose one when you fire the weapon. If the weapon has the aeon trait and a spell gem installed, you can use one of the previously listed traits if the spell of the spell gem slotted in the weapon has that trait, and this does not require you to cast the spell and is a constant effect.

### Critical

This weapon uses the critical weapon specialization of the listed weapon type rather than its own.

### Graviton

In addition to a normal Strike, you can fire this weapon using the Graviton Push action.

**Graviton Push** [two actions] (force) You fire a specialized beam of gravitons at a creature or object within the weapon's first range increment. The graviton beam can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a *telekinetic haul* or a *telekinetic maneuver* spell. The graviton beam can move objects of no more than 20 Bulk up to 20 feet per round. If used as a *telekinetic maneuver*, the action gains the attack trait and uses the weapon's attack modifier instead of a spell attack modifier. Graviton Push has a usage of 2.

### Grenade

A grenade is a device designed to detonate after being thrown. See [Grenade^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#grenade) for more details.

### Module

Items with the Module trait usually need to be slotted in another item before they can provide their full functionality. Modules often have different variants, allowing those with the receptacle item to change their functionality depending on what variant of module is inserted.

### Pharmaceutical

A Pharmaceutical is typically an alchemical consumable that is activated by either ingesting them, or having them injected into a creature with the use of a [medlance^](/Technology%20Guide/Gear/README.md#medlance). To identify a pharmaceutical, use the [Identify Pharmaceutical^](/Technology%20Guide/README.md#identify-pharmaceutical) action.

### Powered

This melee weapon uses a battery. You can activate or deactivate a powered weapon with an Interact action or as part of drawing or stowing it. This weapon comes with a commercial battery installed and uses 1 charge per day (rather than 1 charge per attack). If you try to attack with a powered weapon that’s out of charges or is deactivated, it functions as an improvised weapon.

### Signal

Items with the Signal trait can remotely interact with other objects via a wireless signal. Signals usually state their range in their entries and are affected according to the sidebar on *[Technology Guide, pg. 43](https://paizo.com/products/btpy98i0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide)*

### Timeworn

Items with the timeworn trait cannot be recharged and always has the new glitching condition with a value of 3. Items with the timeworn trait are treated as having the tech trait for the purpose of the glitching condition.

***New Condition: Glitching***

Glitching is a condition that affects objects or creatures with the tech trait, and it always includes a value. A glitching creature or object experiences a combination of debilitating effects and moments of seizing up. If you have glitching equipment and take any action involving that equipment, you must attempt a DC 10 flat check to see what occurs. If you have the glitching condition on yourself, you must make this flat check at the beginning of every round.

**Critical Success** Reduce the glitching value by 1.

**Success** You act as normal or use your equipment as normal.

**Failure** You take an item penalty on all your checks and DCs equal to your glitching value or the glitching value on the item you’re attempting to use.

**Critical Failure** You count as stunned 1 for the round. Alternatively, the object you tried to use doesn’t function, and you lose the actions you took to attempt to use it.

### Tracking

This weapon has been developed with several integrated targeting, stabilizing, and homing systems. Attack rolls with this weapon gain an item bonus equal to the listed value.

### Unwieldy

Weapons with this trait are large and awkward, can’t be fired without cooling down first, or are otherwise difficult to use with repeated attacks. You can’t use an unwieldy weapon more than once per round and can’t use it to Strike as part of a reaction, such as Punitive Strike.

### Usage

This indicates how much ammunition is consumed with each Strike you make with the weapon. Anytime the weapon is fired, its ammunition is lowered by the number indicated.
